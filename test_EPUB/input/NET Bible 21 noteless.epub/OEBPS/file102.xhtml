<h1>Leviticus<br />Chapter 9</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Inauguration of Tabernacle Worship </p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">9:1</span> On the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel, <span class="verse">9:2</span> and said to Aaron, “Take for yourself a bull calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, both flawless, and present them before the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse">9:3</span> Then tell the Israelites: ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering and a calf and a lamb, both a year old and flawless, for a burnt offering, <span class="verse">9:4</span> and an ox and a ram for peace offerings to sacrifice before the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, and a grain offering mixed with olive oil, for today the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> is going to appear to you.’” <span class="verse">9:5</span> So they took what Moses had commanded to the front of the Meeting Tent and the whole congregation presented them and stood before the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse">9:6</span> Then Moses said, “This is what the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> has commanded you to do so that the glory of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> may appear to you.” <span class="verse">9:7</span> Moses then said to Aaron, “Approach the altar and make your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make atonement on behalf of yourself and on behalf of the people; and also make the people’s offering and make atonement on behalf of them just as the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> has commanded.” </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">The Sin Offering for the Priests</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">9:8</span> So Aaron approached the altar and slaughtered the sin offering calf which was for himself. <span class="verse">9:9</span> Then Aaron’s sons presented the blood to him and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar, and the rest of the blood he poured out at the base of the altar. <span class="verse">9:10</span> The fat and the kidneys and the protruding lobe of the liver from the sin offering he offered up in smoke on the altar just as the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> had commanded Moses, <span class="verse">9:11</span> but the flesh and the hide he completely burned up outside the camp. </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">The Burnt Offering for the Priests</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">9:12</span> He then slaughtered the burnt offering, and his sons handed the blood to him and he splashed it against the altar’s sides. <span class="verse">9:13</span> The burnt offering itself they handed to him by its parts, including the head, and he offered them up in smoke on the altar, <span class="verse">9:14</span> and he washed the entrails and the legs and offered them up in smoke on top of the burnt offering on the altar. </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">The Offerings for the People </p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">9:15</span> Then he presented the people’s offering. He took the sin offering male goat which was for the people, slaughtered it, and performed a purification rite with it like the first one. <span class="verse">9:16</span> He then presented the burnt offering, and did it according to the standard regulation. <span class="verse">9:17</span> Next he presented the grain offering, filled his hand with some of it, and offered it up in smoke on the altar in addition to the morning burnt offering. <span class="verse">9:18</span> Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram—the peace-offering sacrifices which were for the people—and Aaron’s sons handed the blood to him and he splashed it against the altar’s sides. <span class="verse">9:19</span> As for the fat parts from the ox and from the ram (the fatty tail, the fat covering the entrails, the kidneys, and the protruding lobe of the liver), <span class="verse">9:20</span> they set those on the breasts and he offered the fat parts up in smoke on the altar. <span class="verse">9:21</span> Finally Aaron waved the breasts and the right thigh as a wave offering before the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> just as Moses had commanded. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">9:22</span> Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them and descended from making the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offering. <span class="verse">9:23</span> Moses and Aaron then entered into the Meeting Tent. When they came out, they blessed the people, and the glory of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> appeared to all the people. <span class="verse">9:24</span> Then fire went out from the presence of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> and consumed the burnt offering and the fat parts on the altar, and all the people saw it, so they shouted loudly and fell down with their faces to the ground. </p>
