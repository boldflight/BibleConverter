<h1>1 Corinthians<br />Chapter 4</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">The Apostles’ Ministry</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">4:1</span> One should think about us this way—as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God. <span class="verse">4:2</span> Now what is sought in stewards is that one be found faithful. <span class="verse">4:3</span> So for me, it is a minor matter that I am judged by you or by any human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself. <span class="verse">4:4</span> For I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not acquitted because of this. The one who judges me is the Lord. <span class="verse">4:5</span> So then, do not judge anything before the time. Wait until the Lord comes. He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the motives of hearts. Then each will receive recognition from God. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">4:6</span> I have applied these things to myself and Apollos because of you, brothers and sisters, so that through us you may learn “not to go beyond what is written,” so that none of you will be puffed up in favor of the one against the other. <span class="verse">4:7</span> For who concedes you any superiority? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you received it, why do you boast as though you did not? <span class="verse">4:8</span> Already you are satisfied! Already you are rich! You have become kings without us! I wish you had become kings so that we could reign with you! <span class="verse">4:9</span> For, I think, God has exhibited us apostles last of all, as men condemned to die, because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to people. <span class="verse">4:10</span> We are fools for Christ, but you are wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are distinguished, we are dishonored! <span class="verse">4:11</span> To the present hour we are hungry and thirsty, poorly clothed, brutally treated, and without a roof over our heads. <span class="verse">4:12</span> We do hard work, toiling with our own hands. When we are verbally abused, we respond with a blessing, when persecuted, we endure, <span class="verse">4:13</span> when people lie about us, we answer in a friendly manner. We are the world’s dirt and scum, even now. </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">A Father’s Warning</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">4:14</span> I am not writing these things to shame you, but to correct you as my dear children. <span class="verse">4:15</span> For though you may have 10,000 guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers, because I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel. <span class="verse">4:16</span> I encourage you, then, be imitators of me. <span class="verse">4:17</span> For this reason, I have sent Timothy to you, who is my dear and faithful son in the Lord. He will remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach them everywhere in every church. <span class="verse">4:18</span> Some have become arrogant, as if I were not coming to you. <span class="verse">4:19</span> But I will come to you soon, if the Lord is willing, and I will find out not only the talk of these arrogant people, but also their power. <span class="verse">4:20</span> For the kingdom of God is demonstrated not in idle talk but with power. <span class="verse">4:21</span> What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod of discipline or with love and a spirit of gentleness? </p>
