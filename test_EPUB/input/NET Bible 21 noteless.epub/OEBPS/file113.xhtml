<p class="paragraphtitle">Prohibitions against Illegitimate Family Worship</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">20:1</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> spoke to Moses: <span class="verse">20:2</span> “You are to say to the Israelites, ‘Any man from the Israelites (or any of the resident foreigners who live in Israel) who gives any of his children to Molech must be put to death; the people of the land must pelt him with stones. <span class="verse">20:3</span> I myself will set my face against that man and cut him off from the midst of his people, because he has given some of his children to Molech and thereby defiled my sanctuary and profaned my holy name. <span class="verse">20:4</span> If, however, the people of the land shut their eyes to that man when he gives some of his children to Molech so that they do not put him to death, <span class="verse">20:5</span> I myself will set my face against that man and his clan. I will cut off from the midst of the people both him and all who follow after him in spiritual prostitution, committing prostitution by worshiping Molech. </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Prohibition against Spiritists and Mediums </p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">20:6</span> “‘The person who turns to the spirits of the dead and familiar spirits to commit prostitution by going after them, I will set my face against that person and cut him off from the midst of his people. </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Exhortation to Holiness and Obedience</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">20:7</span> “‘You must sanctify yourselves and be holy, because I am the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> your God. <span class="verse">20:8</span> You must be sure to obey my statutes. I am the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> who sanctifies you.</p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Family Life and Sexual Prohibitions </p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">20:9</span> “‘If anyone curses his father or mother he must be put to death. He has cursed his father or mother; his blood guilt is on himself. <span class="verse">20:10</span> If a man commits adultery with his neighbor’s wife, both the adulterer and the adulteress must be put to death. <span class="verse">20:11</span> If a man goes to bed with his father’s wife, he has exposed his father’s nakedness. Both of them must be put to death; their blood guilt is on themselves. <span class="verse">20:12</span> If a man goes to bed with his daughter-in-law, both of them must be put to death. They have committed perversion; their blood guilt is on themselves. <span class="verse">20:13</span> If a man goes to bed with a male as one goes to bed with a woman, the two of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood guilt is on themselves. <span class="verse">20:14</span> If a man has marital relations with both a woman and her mother,  it is lewdness. Both he and they must be burned to death, so there is no lewdness in your midst. <span class="verse">20:15</span> If a man has sexual relations with any animal, he must be put to death, and you must kill the animal. <span class="verse">20:16</span> If a woman approaches any animal to copulate with it, you must kill the woman, and the animal must be put to death; their blood guilt is on themselves.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">20:17</span> “‘If a man has marital relations with his sister, whether the daughter of his father or of his mother, so that he sees her nakedness and she sees his nakedness, it is a disgrace. They must be cut off in the sight of the children of their people. He has exposed his sister’s nakedness; he will bear his punishment for iniquity. <span class="verse">20:18</span> If a man goes to bed with a menstruating woman and uncovers her nakedness, he has laid bare her fountain of blood and she has exposed the fountain of her blood, so both of them must be cut off from the midst of their people. <span class="verse">20:19</span> You must not expose the nakedness of your mother’s sister or your father’s sister, for such a person has exposed his own close relative. They must bear their punishment for iniquity. <span class="verse">20:20</span> If a man goes to bed with his aunt, he has exposed his uncle’s nakedness; they must bear responsibility for their sin, they will die childless. <span class="verse">20:21</span> If a man has marital relations with his brother’s wife, it is indecency. He has exposed his brother’s nakedness; they will be childless. </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Exhortation to Holiness and Obedience </p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">20:22</span> “‘You must be sure to obey all my statutes and regulations, so that the land to which I am about to bring you to take up residence does not vomit you out. <span class="verse">20:23</span> You must not walk in the statutes of the nations which I am about to drive out before you, because they have done all these things and I am filled with disgust against them. <span class="verse">20:24</span> So I have said to you: You yourselves will possess their land and I myself will give it to you for a possession, a land flowing with milk and honey. I am the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> your God who has set you apart from the other peoples. <span class="verse">20:25</span> Therefore you must distinguish between the clean animal and the unclean, and between the unclean bird and the clean, and you must not make yourselves detestable by means of an animal or bird or anything that creeps on the ground—creatures I have distinguished for you as unclean. <span class="verse">20:26</span> You must be holy to me because I, the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, am holy, and I have set you apart from the other peoples to be mine.</p>
