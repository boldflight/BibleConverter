<h1>1 Timothy<br />Chapter 1</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Salutation</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1:1</span> From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope, <span class="verse">1:2</span> to Timothy, my genuine child in the faith. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord! </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Timothy’s Task in Ephesus</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1:3</span> As I urged you when I was leaving for Macedonia, stay on in Ephesus to instruct certain people not to spread false teachings, <span class="verse">1:4</span> nor to occupy themselves with myths and interminable genealogies. Such things promote useless speculations rather than God’s redemptive plan that operates by faith. <span class="verse">1:5</span> But the aim of our instruction is love that comes from a pure heart, a good conscience, and a sincere faith. <span class="verse">1:6</span> Some have strayed from these and turned away to empty discussion. <span class="verse">1:7</span> They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not understand what they are saying or the things they insist on so confidently. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1:8</span> But we know that the law is good if someone uses it legitimately, <span class="verse">1:9</span> realizing that law is not intended for a righteous person, but for lawless and rebellious people, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers, <span class="verse">1:10</span> sexually immoral people, practicing homosexuals, kidnappers, liars, perjurers—in fact, for any who live contrary to sound teaching. <span class="verse">1:11</span> This accords with the glorious gospel of the blessed God that was entrusted to me. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1:12</span> I am grateful to the one who has strengthened me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he considered me faithful in putting me into ministry, <span class="verse">1:13</span> even though I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor, and an arrogant man. But I was treated with mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief, <span class="verse">1:14</span> and our Lord’s grace was abundant, bringing faith and love in Christ Jesus. <span class="verse">1:15</span> This saying is trustworthy and deserves full acceptance: “Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners”—and I am the worst of them! <span class="verse">1:16</span> But here is why I was treated with mercy: so that in me as the worst, Christ Jesus could demonstrate his utmost patience, as an example for those who are going to believe in him for eternal life. <span class="verse">1:17</span> Now to the eternal king, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever! Amen. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1:18</span> I put this charge before you, Timothy my child, in keeping with the prophecies once spoken about you, in order that with such encouragement you may fight the good fight. <span class="verse">1:19</span> To do this you must hold firmly to faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and so have suffered shipwreck in regard to the faith. <span class="verse">1:20</span> Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I handed over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme. </p>
