<h1>James<br />Chapter 1</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Salutation</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1:1</span> From James, a slave of God and the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes dispersed abroad. Greetings! </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Joy in Trials</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1:2</span> My brothers and sisters, consider it nothing but joy when you fall into all sorts of trials, <span class="verse">1:3</span> because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance. <span class="verse">1:4</span> And let endurance have its perfect effect, so that you will be perfect and complete, not deficient in anything. <span class="verse">1:5</span> But if anyone is deficient in wisdom, he should ask God, who gives to all generously and without reprimand, and it will be given to him. <span class="verse">1:6</span> But he must ask in faith without doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed around by the wind. <span class="verse">1:7</span> For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord, <span class="verse">1:8</span> since he is a double-minded individual, unstable in all his ways. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1:9</span> Now the believer of humble means should take pride in his high position. <span class="verse">1:10</span> But the rich person’s pride should be in his humiliation, because he will pass away like a wildflower in the meadow. <span class="verse">1:11</span> For the sun rises with its heat and dries up the meadow; the petal of the flower falls off and its beauty is lost forever. So also the rich person in the midst of his pursuits will wither away. <span class="verse">1:12</span> Happy is the one who endures testing, because when he has proven to be genuine, he will receive the crown of life that God promised to those who love him. <span class="verse">1:13</span> Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am tempted by God,” for God cannot be tempted by evil, and he himself tempts no one. <span class="verse">1:14</span> But each one is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desires. <span class="verse">1:15</span> Then when desire conceives, it gives birth to sin, and when sin is full grown, it gives birth to death. <span class="verse">1:16</span> Do not be led astray, my dear brothers and sisters. <span class="verse">1:17</span> All generous giving and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or the slightest hint of change. <span class="verse">1:18</span> By his sovereign plan he gave us birth through the message of truth, that we would be a kind of firstfruits of all he created. </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Living Out the Message</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1:19</span> Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters! Let every person be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger. <span class="verse">1:20</span> For human anger does not accomplish God’s righteousness. <span class="verse">1:21</span> So put away all filth and evil excess and humbly welcome the message implanted within you, which is able to save your souls. <span class="verse">1:22</span> But be sure you live out the message and do not merely listen to it and so deceive yourselves. <span class="verse">1:23</span> For if someone merely listens to the message and does not live it out, he is like someone who gazes at his own face in a mirror. <span class="verse">1:24</span> For he gazes at himself and then goes out and immediately forgets what sort of person he was. <span class="verse">1:25</span> But the one who peers into the perfect law of liberty and fixes his attention there, and does not become a forgetful listener but one who lives it out—he will be blessed in what he does. <span class="verse">1:26</span> If someone thinks he is religious yet does not bridle his tongue, and so deceives his heart, his religion is futile. <span class="verse">1:27</span> Pure and undefiled religion before God the Father is this: to care for orphans and widows in their adversity and to keep oneself unstained by the world. </p>
