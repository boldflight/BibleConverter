<h1>2 Peter<br />Chapter 2</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">The False Teachers’ Ungodly Lifestyle</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">2:1</span> But false prophets arose among the people,  just as there will be false teachers among you. These false teachers will infiltrate your midst with destructive heresies, even to the point of denying the Master who bought them. As a result, they will bring swift destruction on themselves. <span class="verse">2:2</span> And many will follow their debauched lifestyles. Because of these false teachers, the way of truth will be slandered. <span class="verse">2:3</span> And in their greed they will exploit you with deceptive words. Their condemnation pronounced long ago is not sitting idly by; their destruction is not asleep. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">2:4</span> For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but threw them into hell and locked them up in chains in utter darkness, to be kept until the judgment, <span class="verse">2:5</span> and if he did not spare the ancient world, but did protect Noah, a herald of righteousness, along with seven others, when God brought a flood on an ungodly world, <span class="verse">2:6</span> and if he turned to ashes the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah when he condemned them to destruction, having appointed them to serve as an example to future generations of the ungodly, <span class="verse">2:7</span> and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man in anguish over the debauched lifestyle of lawless men, <span class="verse">2:8</span> (for while he lived among them day after day, that righteous man was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard) <span class="verse">2:9</span> —if so, then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from their trials, and to reserve the unrighteous for punishment at the day of judgment, <span class="verse">2:10</span> especially those who indulge their fleshly desires and who despise authority. </p>
<p class="bodytext">Brazen and insolent, they are not afraid to insult the glorious ones, <span class="verse">2:11</span> yet even angels, who are much more powerful, do not bring a slanderous judgment against them in the presence of the Lord. <span class="verse">2:12</span> But these men, like irrational animals—creatures of instinct, born to be caught and destroyed —do not understand whom they are insulting, and consequently in their destruction they will be destroyed, <span class="verse">2:13</span> suffering harm as the wages for their harmful ways. By considering it a pleasure to carouse in broad daylight, they are stains and blemishes, indulging in their deceitful pleasures when they feast together with you. <span class="verse">2:14</span> Their eyes, full of adultery, never stop sinning; they entice unstable people. They have trained their hearts for greed, these cursed children! <span class="verse">2:15</span> By forsaking the right path they have gone astray, because they followed the way of Balaam son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness, <span class="verse">2:16</span> yet was rebuked for his own transgression (a dumb donkey, speaking with a human voice, restrained the prophet’s madness). </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">2:17</span> These men are waterless springs and mists driven by a storm, for whom the utter depths of darkness have been reserved. <span class="verse">2:18</span> For by speaking high-sounding but empty words they are able to entice, with fleshly desires and with debauchery, people who have just escaped from those who reside in error. <span class="verse">2:19</span> Although these false teachers promise such people freedom, they themselves are enslaved to immorality. For whatever a person succumbs to, to that he is enslaved. <span class="verse">2:20</span> For if after they have escaped the filthy things of the world through the rich knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they again get entangled in them and succumb to them, their last state has become worse for them than their first. <span class="verse">2:21</span> For it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than, having known it, to turn back from the holy commandment that had been delivered to them. <span class="verse">2:22</span> They are illustrations of this true proverb: “<b><i>A dog returns to its own vomit</i></b>,” and “A sow, after washing herself, wallows in the mire.” </p>
