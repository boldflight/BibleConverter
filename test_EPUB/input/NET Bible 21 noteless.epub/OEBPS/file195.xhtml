<h1>Joshua<br />Chapter 2</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Joshua Sends Spies into the Land</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">2:1</span> Joshua son of Nun sent two spies out from Shittim secretly and instructed them: “Find out what you can about the land, especially Jericho.” They stopped at the house of a prostitute named Rahab and spent the night there. <span class="verse">2:2</span> The king of Jericho received this report: “Note well! Israelite men have come here tonight to spy on the land.” <span class="verse">2:3</span> So the king of Jericho sent this order to Rahab: “Turn over the men who came to you —the ones who came to your house —for they have come to spy on the whole land!” <span class="verse">2:4</span> But the woman hid the two men and replied, “Yes, these men were clients of mine, but I didn’t know where they came from. <span class="verse">2:5</span> When it was time to shut the city gate for the night, the men left. I don’t know where they were heading. Chase after them quickly, for you have time to catch them!” <span class="verse">2:6</span> (Now she had taken them up to the roof and had hidden them in the stalks of flax she had spread out on the roof.) <span class="verse">2:7</span> Meanwhile, the king’s men tried to find them on the road to the Jordan River near the fords. The city gate was shut as soon as they set out in pursuit of them. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">2:8</span> Now before the spies went to sleep, Rahab went up to the roof. <span class="verse">2:9</span> She said to the men, “I know the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> is handing this land over to you. We are absolutely terrified of you, and all who live in the land are cringing before you. <span class="verse">2:10</span> For we heard how the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you left Egypt and how you annihilated the two Amorite kings, Sihon and Og, on the other side of the Jordan. <span class="verse">2:11</span> When we heard the news we lost our courage and no one could even breathe for fear of you. For the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> your God is God in heaven above and on earth below! <span class="verse">2:12</span> So now, promise me this with an oath sworn in the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s name. Because I have shown allegiance to you, show allegiance to my family. Give me a solemn pledge <span class="verse">2:13</span> that you will spare the lives of my father, mother, brothers, sisters, and all who belong to them, and will rescue us from death.” <span class="verse">2:14</span> The men said to her, “If you die, may we die too! If you do not report what we’ve been up to, then we will show unswerving allegiance to you when the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> hands the land over to us.” </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">2:15</span> Then Rahab let them down by a rope through the window. (Her house was built as part of the city wall; she lived in the wall.) <span class="verse">2:16</span> She told them, “Head to the hill country, so the ones chasing you don’t find you. Hide from them there for three days, long enough for those chasing you to return. Then you can be on your way.” <span class="verse">2:17</span> The men said to her, “We are not bound by this oath you made us swear unless the following conditions are met: <span class="verse">2:18</span> When we invade the land, tie this red rope in the window through which you let us down, and gather together in your house your father, mother, brothers, and all who live in your father’s house. <span class="verse">2:19</span> Anyone who leaves your house will be responsible for his own death—we are innocent in that case! But if anyone with you in the house is harmed, we will be responsible. <span class="verse">2:20</span> If you should report what we’ve been up to, we are not bound by this oath you made us swear.” <span class="verse">2:21</span> She said, “I agree to these conditions.” She sent them on their way and then tied the red rope in the window. <span class="verse">2:22</span> They went to the hill country and stayed there for three days, long enough for those chasing them to return. Their pursuers looked all along the way but did not find them. <span class="verse">2:23</span> Then the two men returned—they came down from the hills, crossed the river, came to Joshua son of Nun, and reported to him all they had discovered. <span class="verse">2:24</span> They told Joshua, “Surely the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> is handing over all the land to us! All who live in the land are cringing before us!” </p>
