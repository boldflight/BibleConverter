<h1>2 Kings<br />Chapter 3</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Moab Fights with Israel </p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">3:1</span> In the eighteenth year of King Jehoshaphat’s reign over Judah, Ahab’s son Jehoram became king over Israel in Samaria; he ruled for twelve years. <span class="verse">3:2</span> He did evil in the sight of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, but not to the same degree as his father and mother. He did remove the sacred pillar of Baal that his father had made. <span class="verse">3:3</span> Yet he persisted in the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who encouraged Israel to sin; he did not turn from them. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">3:4</span> Now King Mesha of Moab was a sheep breeder. He would send as tribute to the king of Israel 100,000 male lambs and the wool of 100,000 rams. <span class="verse">3:5</span> When Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. <span class="verse">3:6</span> At that time King Jehoram left Samaria and assembled all Israel for war. <span class="verse">3:7</span> He sent this message to King Jehoshaphat of Judah: “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you fight with me against Moab?” Jehoshaphat replied, “I will join you in the campaign; my army and horses are at your disposal.” <span class="verse">3:8</span> He then asked, “Which invasion route are we going to take?” Jehoram answered, “By the road through the wilderness of Edom.” <span class="verse">3:9</span> So the kings of Israel, Judah, and Edom set out together. They wandered around on the road for seven days and finally ran out of water for the men and animals they had with them. <span class="verse">3:10</span> The king of Israel said, “Oh no! Certainly the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> has summoned these three kings so that he can hand them over to the king of Moab!” <span class="verse">3:11</span> Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there no prophet of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> here that we might seek the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s direction?” One of the servants of the king of Israel answered, “Elisha son of Shapat is here; he used to be Elijah’s servant.” <span class="verse">3:12</span> Jehoshaphat said, “Yes, he receives the <span class="smcaps">Lord’</span>s messages.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to visit him. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">3:13</span> Elisha said to the king of Israel, “Why are you here? Go to your father’s prophets or your mother’s prophets!” The king of Israel replied to him, “No, for the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> is the one who summoned these three kings so that he can hand them over to Moab.” <span class="verse">3:14</span> Elisha said, “As certainly as the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies lives (whom I serve), if I did not respect King Jehoshaphat of Judah, I would not pay attention to you or acknowledge you. <span class="verse">3:15</span> But now, get me a musician.” When the musician played, the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> energized him, <span class="verse">3:16</span> and he said, “This is what the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> has said, ‘Make many cisterns in this valley,’ <span class="verse">3:17</span> for this is what the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> has said, ‘You will not feel any wind or see any rain, but this valley will be full of water, and you and your cattle and animals will drink.’ <span class="verse">3:18</span> This is an easy task for the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>; he will also hand Moab over to you. <span class="verse">3:19</span> You will defeat every fortified city and every important city. You must chop down every productive tree, stop up all the springs, and cover all the cultivated land with stones.” </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">3:20</span> Sure enough, the next morning, at the time of the morning sacrifice, water came flowing down from Edom and filled the land. <span class="verse">3:21</span> Now all Moab had heard that the kings were attacking, so everyone old enough to fight was mustered and placed at the border. <span class="verse">3:22</span> When they got up early the next morning, the sun was shining on the water. To the Moabites, who were some distance away, the water looked red like blood. <span class="verse">3:23</span> The Moabites said, “It’s blood! The kings must have fought one another! The soldiers have struck one another down! Now, Moab, seize the plunder!” <span class="verse">3:24</span> When they approached the Israelite camp, the Israelites rose up and struck down the Moabites, who then ran from them. The Israelites thoroughly defeated Moab. <span class="verse">3:25</span> They tore down the cities, and each man threw a stone into every cultivated field until they were covered. They stopped up every spring and chopped down every productive tree. </p>
<p class="bodytext">Only Kir Hareseth was left intact, but the soldiers armed with slings surrounded it and attacked it. <span class="verse">3:26</span> When the king of Moab realized he was losing the battle, he and 700 swordsmen tried to break through and attack the king of Edom, but they failed. <span class="verse">3:27</span> So he took his firstborn son, who was to succeed him as king, and offered him up as a burnt sacrifice on the wall. There was an outburst of divine anger against Israel, so they broke off the attack and returned to their homeland. </p>
