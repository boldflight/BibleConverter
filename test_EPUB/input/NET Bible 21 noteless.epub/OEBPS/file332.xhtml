<h1>2 Kings<br />Chapter 7</h1>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">6:32</span> Now Elisha was sitting in his house with the community leaders. The king sent a messenger on ahead, but before he arrived, Elisha said to the leaders, “Do you realize this assassin intends to cut off my head? Look, when the messenger arrives, shut the door and lean against it. His master will certainly be right behind him.” <span class="verse">6:33</span> He was still talking to them when the messenger approached and said, “Look, the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> is responsible for this disaster! Why should I continue to wait for the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> to help?” <span class="verse">7:1</span> Elisha replied, “Listen to the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s message. This is what the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> has said, ‘About this time tomorrow a seah of finely milled flour will sell for a shekel and two seahs of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria.’” <span class="verse">7:2</span> An officer who was the king’s right-hand man responded to the prophet, “Look, even if the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> made it rain by opening holes in the sky, could this happen so soon?” Elisha said, “Look, you will see it happen with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of the food!” </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">7:3</span> Now four men with a skin disease were sitting at the entrance of the city gate. They said to one another, “Why are we just sitting here waiting to die? <span class="verse">7:4</span> If we go into the city, we’ll die of starvation, and if we stay here we’ll die! So come on, let’s defect to the Syrian camp! If they spare us, we’ll live; if they kill us—well, we were going to die anyway.” <span class="verse">7:5</span> So they started toward the Syrian camp at dusk. When they reached the edge of the Syrian camp, there was no one there. <span class="verse">7:6</span> The Lord had caused the Syrian camp to hear the sound of chariots and horses and a large army. Then they said to one another, “Look, the king of Israel has paid the kings of the Hittites and Egyptians to attack us!” <span class="verse">7:7</span> So they got up and fled at dusk, leaving behind their tents, horses, and donkeys. They left the camp as it was and ran for their lives. <span class="verse">7:8</span> When the men with a skin disease reached the edge of the camp, they entered a tent and had a meal. They also took some silver, gold, and clothes and went and hid it all. Then they went back and entered another tent. They looted it and went and hid what they had taken. <span class="verse">7:9</span> Then they said to one another, “It’s not right what we’re doing! This is a day to celebrate, but we haven’t told anyone. If we wait until dawn, we’ll be punished. So come on, let’s go and inform the royal palace.” <span class="verse">7:10</span> So they went and called out to the gatekeepers of the city. They told them, “We entered the Syrian camp and there was no one there. We didn’t even hear a man’s voice. But the horses and donkeys are still tied up, and the tents remain up.” <span class="verse">7:11</span> The gatekeepers relayed the news to the royal palace. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">7:12</span> The king got up in the night and said to his advisers, “I will tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They know we are starving, so they left the camp and hid in the field, thinking, ‘When they come out of the city, we will capture them alive and enter the city.’” <span class="verse">7:13</span> One of his advisers replied, “Pick some men and have them take five of the horses that are left in the city. (Even if they are killed, their fate will be no different than that of all the Israelite people—we’re all going to die!) Let’s send them out so we can know for sure what’s going on.” <span class="verse">7:14</span> So they picked two horsemen and the king sent them out to track the Syrian army. He ordered them, “Go and find out what’s going on.” <span class="verse">7:15</span> So they tracked them as far as the Jordan. The road was filled with clothes and equipment that the Syrians had discarded in their haste. The scouts went back and told the king. <span class="verse">7:16</span> Then the people went out and looted the Syrian camp. A seah of finely milled flour sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, just as in the <span class="smcaps">Lord’</span>s message.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">7:17</span> Now the king had placed the officer who was his right-hand man at the city gate. When the people rushed out, they trampled him to death in the gate. This fulfilled the prophet’s word which he had spoken when the king tried to arrest him. <span class="verse">7:18</span> The prophet had told the king, “Two seahs of barley will sell for a shekel, and a seah of finely milled flour for a shekel; this will happen about this time tomorrow in the gate of Samaria.” <span class="verse">7:19</span> But the officer had replied to the prophet, “Look, even if the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> made it rain by opening holes in the sky, could this happen so soon?” Elisha had said, “Look, you will see it happen with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of the food!” <span class="verse">7:20</span> This is exactly what happened to him. The people trampled him to death in the city gate. </p>
