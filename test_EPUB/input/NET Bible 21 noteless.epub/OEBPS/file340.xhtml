<p class="paragraphtitle">Azariah’s Reign over Judah</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">15:1</span> In the twenty-seventh year of King Jeroboam’s reign over Israel, Amaziah’s son Azariah became king over Judah. <span class="verse">15:2</span> He was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jecholiah, who was from Jerusalem. <span class="verse">15:3</span> He did what the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> approved, just as his father Amaziah had done. <span class="verse">15:4</span> But the high places were not eliminated; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense on the high places. <span class="verse">15:5</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> afflicted the king with an illness; he suffered from a skin disease until the day he died. He lived in separate quarters, while his son Jotham was in charge of the palace and ruled over the people of the land. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">15:6</span> The rest of the events of Azariah’s reign, including all his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Judah. <span class="verse">15:7</span> Azariah passed away and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. His son Jotham replaced him as king. </p>
