<h1>2 Kings<br />Chapter 18</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Hezekiah Becomes King of Judah</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">18:1</span> In the third year of the reign of Israel’s King Hoshea son of Elah, Ahaz’s son Hezekiah became king over Judah. <span class="verse">18:2</span> He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother was Abi, the daughter of Zechariah. <span class="verse">18:3</span> He did what the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> approved, just as his ancestor David had done. <span class="verse">18:4</span> He eliminated the high places, smashed the sacred pillars to bits, and cut down the Asherah pole. He also demolished the bronze serpent that Moses had made, for up to that time the Israelites had been offering incense to it; it was called Nehushtan. <span class="verse">18:5</span> He trusted in the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> God of Israel; in this regard there was none like him among the kings of Judah either before or after. <span class="verse">18:6</span> He was loyal to the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> and did not abandon him. He obeyed the commandments that the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> had given to Moses. <span class="verse">18:7</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> was with him; he succeeded in all his endeavors. He rebelled against the king of Assyria and refused to submit to him. <span class="verse">18:8</span> He defeated the Philistines as far as Gaza and its territory, from watchtower to fortified city. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">18:9</span> In the fourth year of King Hezekiah’s reign (it was the seventh year of the reign of Israel’s King Hoshea, son of Elah), King Shalmaneser of Assyria marched up against Samaria and besieged it. <span class="verse">18:10</span> After three years he captured it (in the sixth year of Hezekiah’s reign); in the ninth year of King Hoshea’s reign over Israel, Samaria was captured. <span class="verse">18:11</span> The king of Assyria deported the people of Israel to Assyria. He settled them in Halah, along the Habor (the river of Gozan), and in the cities of the Medes. <span class="verse">18:12</span> This happened because they did not obey the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> their God and broke his covenant with them. They did not pay attention to and obey all that Moses, the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s servant, had commanded. </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Sennacherib Invades Judah</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">18:13</span> In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah’s reign, King Sennacherib of Assyria marched up against all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. <span class="verse">18:14</span> King Hezekiah of Judah sent this message to the king of Assyria, who was at Lachish, “I have violated our treaty. If you leave, I will do whatever you demand.” So the king of Assyria demanded that King Hezekiah of Judah pay 300 talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. <span class="verse">18:15</span> Hezekiah gave him all the silver in the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s temple and in the treasuries of the royal palace. <span class="verse">18:16</span> At that time King Hezekiah of Judah stripped the metal overlays from the doors of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s temple and from the posts that he had plated and gave them to the king of Assyria. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">18:17</span> The king of Assyria sent his commanding general, the chief eunuch, and the chief adviser from Lachish to King Hezekiah in Jerusalem, along with a large army. They went up and arrived at Jerusalem. They went and stood at the conduit of the upper pool which is located on the road to the field where they wash and dry cloth. <span class="verse">18:18</span> They summoned the king, so Eliakim son of Hilkiah, the palace supervisor, accompanied by Shebna, the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph, the secretary, went out to meet them.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">18:19</span> The chief adviser said to them, “Tell Hezekiah: ‘This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: “What is your source of confidence? <span class="verse">18:20</span> Your claim to have a strategy and military strength is just empty talk. In whom are you trusting that you would dare to rebel against me? <span class="verse">18:21</span> Now look, you must be trusting in Egypt, that splintered reed staff. If a man leans for support on it, it punctures his hand and wounds him. That is what Pharaoh king of Egypt does to all who trust in him. <span class="verse">18:22</span> Perhaps you will tell me, ‘We are trusting in the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> our God.’ But Hezekiah is the one who eliminated his high places and altars and then told the people of Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You must worship at this altar in Jerusalem.’ <span class="verse">18:23</span> Now make a deal with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you 2,000 horses, provided you can find enough riders for them. <span class="verse">18:24</span> Certainly you will not refuse one of my master’s minor officials and trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen. <span class="verse">18:25</span> Furthermore it was by the command of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> that I marched up against this place to destroy it. The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> told me, ‘March up against this land and destroy it.’”’” </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">18:26</span> Eliakim son of Hilkiah, Shebna, and Joah said to the chief adviser, “Speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Don’t speak with us in the Judahite dialect in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.” <span class="verse">18:27</span> But the chief adviser said to them, “My master did not send me to speak these words only to your master and to you. His message is also for the men who sit on the wall, for they will eat their own excrement and drink their own urine along with you.” </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">18:28</span> The chief adviser then stood there and called out loudly in the Judahite dialect, “Listen to the message of the great king, the king of Assyria. <span class="verse">18:29</span> This is what the king says: ‘Don’t let Hezekiah mislead you, for he is not able to rescue you from my hand! <span class="verse">18:30</span> Don’t let Hezekiah talk you into trusting in the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> when he says, “The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> will certainly rescue us; this city will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.” <span class="verse">18:31</span> Don’t listen to Hezekiah!’ For this is what the king of Assyria says, ‘Send me a token of your submission and surrender to me. Then each of you may eat from his own vine and fig tree and drink water from his own cistern, <span class="verse">18:32</span> until I come and take you to a land just like your own—a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive oil and honey. Then you will live and not die. Don’t listen to Hezekiah, for he is misleading you when he says, “The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> will rescue us.” <span class="verse">18:33</span> Have any of the gods of the nations actually rescued his land from the power of the king of Assyria? <span class="verse">18:34</span> Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Indeed, did any gods rescue Samaria from my power? <span class="verse">18:35</span> Who among all the gods of the lands has rescued their lands from my power? So how can the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> rescue Jerusalem from my power?’” <span class="verse">18:36</span> The people were silent and did not respond, for the king had ordered, “Don’t respond to him.”</p>
