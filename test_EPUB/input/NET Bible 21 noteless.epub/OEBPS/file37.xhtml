<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">36:2</span> Esau took his wives from the Canaanites: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite, <span class="verse">36:3</span> in addition to Basemath the daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">36:4</span> Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, Basemath bore Reuel, <span class="verse">36:5</span> and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These were the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">36:6</span> Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, all the people in his household, his livestock, his animals, and all his possessions that he had acquired in the land of Canaan, and he went to a land some distance away from Jacob his brother <span class="verse">36:7</span> because they had too many possessions to be able to stay together, and the land where they had settled was not able to support them because of their livestock. <span class="verse">36:8</span> So Esau (also known as Edom) lived in the hill country of Seir. </p>
