<h1>2 Chronicles<br />Chapter 5</h1>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">4:19</span> Solomon also made these items for God’s temple: the gold altar, the tables on which the Bread of the Presence was kept, <span class="verse">4:20</span> the pure gold lampstands and their lamps which burned as specified at the entrance to the inner sanctuary, <span class="verse">4:21</span> the pure gold flower-shaped ornaments, lamps, and tongs, <span class="verse">4:22</span> the pure gold trimming shears, basins, pans, and censers, and the gold door sockets for the inner sanctuary (the Most Holy Place) and for the doors of the main hall of the temple. <span class="verse">5:1</span> When Solomon had finished constructing the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s temple, he put the holy items that belonged to his father David (the silver, gold, and all the other articles) in the treasuries of God’s temple. </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Solomon Moves the Ark into the Temple</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">5:2</span> Then Solomon convened Israel’s elders—all the leaders of the Israelite tribes and families—in Jerusalem, so they could witness the transferal of the ark of the covenant of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> from the City of David (that is, Zion). <span class="verse">5:3</span> All the men of Israel assembled before the king during the festival in the seventh month. <span class="verse">5:4</span> When all Israel’s elders had arrived, the Levites lifted the ark. <span class="verse">5:5</span> The priests and Levites carried the ark, the tent where God appeared to his people, and all the holy items in the tent. <span class="verse">5:6</span> Now King Solomon and all the Israelites who had assembled with him went on ahead of the ark and sacrificed more sheep and cattle than could be counted or numbered. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">5:7</span> The priests brought the ark of the covenant of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> to its assigned place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, in the Most Holy Place under the wings of the cherubim. <span class="verse">5:8</span> The cherubim’s wings extended over the place where the ark sat; the cherubim overshadowed the ark and its poles. <span class="verse">5:9</span> The poles were so long their ends extending out from the ark were visible from in front of the inner sanctuary, but they could not be seen from beyond that point. They have remained there to this very day. <span class="verse">5:10</span> There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets Moses had placed there in Horeb. (It was there that the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> made a covenant with the Israelites after he brought them out of the land of Egypt.) </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">5:11</span> The priests left the Holy Place. All the priests who participated had consecrated themselves, no matter which division they represented. <span class="verse">5:12</span> All the Levites who were musicians, including Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and relatives, wore linen. They played cymbals and stringed instruments as they stood east of the altar. They were accompanied by 120 priests who blew trumpets. <span class="verse">5:13</span> The trumpeters and musicians played together, praising and giving thanks to the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>. Accompanied by trumpets, cymbals, and other instruments, they loudly praised the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, singing: “Certainly he is good; certainly his loyal love endures!” Then a cloud filled the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s temple. <span class="verse">5:14</span> The priests could not carry out their duties because of the cloud; the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s splendor filled God’s temple. </p>
