<h1>2 Chronicles<br />Chapter 25</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Amaziah’s Reign</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">25:1</span> Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jehoaddan, who was from Jerusalem. <span class="verse">25:2</span> He did what the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> approved, but not with wholehearted devotion. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">25:3</span> When he had secured control of the kingdom, he executed the servants who had assassinated his father the king. <span class="verse">25:4</span> However, he did not execute their sons. He obeyed the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s commandment as recorded in the law scroll of Moses, “Fathers must not be executed for what their sons do, and sons must not be executed for what their fathers do. A man must be executed only for his own sin.” </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">25:5</span> Amaziah assembled the people of Judah and assigned them by families to the commanders of units of 1,000 and the commanders of units of 100 for all Judah and Benjamin. He counted those twenty years old and up and discovered there were 300,000 young men of fighting age equipped with spears and shields. <span class="verse">25:6</span> He hired 100,000 Israelite warriors for 100 talents of silver. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">25:7</span> But a prophet visited him and said: “O king, the Israelite troops must not go with you, for the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> is not with Israel or any of the Ephraimites. <span class="verse">25:8</span> Even if you go and fight bravely in battle, God will defeat you before the enemy. God is capable of helping or defeating.” <span class="verse">25:9</span> Amaziah asked the prophet: “But what should I do about the 100 talents of silver I paid the Israelite troops?” The prophet replied, “The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> is capable of giving you more than that.” <span class="verse">25:10</span> So Amaziah dismissed the troops that had come to him from Ephraim and sent them home. They were very angry at Judah and returned home incensed. <span class="verse">25:11</span> Amaziah boldly led his army to the Valley of Salt, where he defeated 10,000 Edomites. <span class="verse">25:12</span> The men of Judah captured 10,000 men alive. They took them to the top of a cliff and threw them over. All the captives fell to their death. <span class="verse">25:13</span> Now the troops Amaziah had dismissed and had not allowed to fight in the battle raided the cities of Judah from Samaria to Beth Horon. They killed 3,000 people and carried off a large amount of plunder. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">25:14</span> When Amaziah returned from defeating the Edomites, he brought back the gods of the people of Seir and made them his personal gods. He bowed down before them and offered them sacrifices. <span class="verse">25:15</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> was angry at Amaziah and sent a prophet to him, who said, “Why are you following these gods that could not deliver their own people from your power?” <span class="verse">25:16</span> While he was speaking, Amaziah said to him, “Did we appoint you to be a royal counselor? Stop prophesying or else you will be killed!” So the prophet stopped, but added, “I know that God has decided to destroy you, because you have done this thing and refused to listen to my advice.” </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">25:17</span> After King Amaziah of Judah consulted with his advisers, he sent this message to the king of Israel, Joash son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, “Come, face me on the battlefield.” <span class="verse">25:18</span> King Joash of Israel sent this message back to King Amaziah of Judah, “A thorn bush in Lebanon sent this message to a cedar in Lebanon, ‘Give your daughter to my son as a wife.’ Then a wild animal of Lebanon came by and trampled down the thorn bush. <span class="verse">25:19</span> You defeated Edom and it has gone to your head. Gloat over your success, but stay in your palace. Why bring calamity on yourself? Why bring down yourself and Judah along with you?” </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">25:20</span> But Amaziah did not heed the warning, for God wanted to hand them over to Joash because they followed the gods of Edom. <span class="verse">25:21</span> So King Joash of Israel attacked. He and King Amaziah of Judah faced each other on the battlefield in Beth Shemesh of Judah. <span class="verse">25:22</span> Judah was defeated by Israel, and each man ran back home. <span class="verse">25:23</span> King Joash of Israel captured King Amaziah of Judah, son of Joash son of Jehoahaz, in Beth Shemesh and brought him to Jerusalem. He broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate—a distance of about 600 feet. <span class="verse">25:24</span> He took away all the gold and silver, all the items found in God’s temple that were in the care of Obed-Edom, the riches in the royal palace, and some hostages. Then he went back to Samaria. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">25:25</span> King Amaziah son of Joash of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of King Joash son of Jehoahaz of Israel. <span class="verse">25:26</span> The rest of the events of Amaziah’s reign, from start to finish, are recorded in the Scroll of the Kings of Judah and Israel. <span class="verse">25:27</span> From the time Amaziah turned from following the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, conspirators plotted against him in Jerusalem, so he fled to Lachish. But they sent assassins after him and they killed him there. <span class="verse">25:28</span> His body was carried back by horses, and he was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. </p>
