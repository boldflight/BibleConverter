<h2>Psalm 11</h2><p class="psasuper">For the music director, by David.</p><p class="poetry"><span class="verse">11:1</span> In the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> I have taken shelter. </p>
<p class="poetry">How can you say to me, </p>
<p class="poetry">“Flee to a mountain like a bird. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">11:2</span> For look, the wicked prepare their bows, </p>
<p class="poetry">they put their arrows on the strings,</p>
<p class="poetry">to shoot in the darkness at the morally upright. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">11:3</span> When the foundations are destroyed,</p>
<p class="poetry">what can the godly accomplish?” </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">11:4</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> is in his holy temple; </p>
<p class="poetry">the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s throne is in heaven. </p>
<p class="poetry">His eyes watch; </p>
<p class="poetry">his eyes examine all people. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">11:5</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> approves of the godly, </p>
<p class="poetry">but he hates the wicked and those who love to do violence. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">11:6</span> May he rain down burning coals and brimstone on the wicked!</p>
<p class="poetry">A whirlwind is what they deserve. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">11:7</span> Certainly the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> is just; </p>
<p class="poetry">he rewards godly deeds. </p>
<p class="poetry">The upright will experience his favor. </p>
