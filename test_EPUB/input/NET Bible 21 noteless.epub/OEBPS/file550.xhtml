<h2>Psalm 53</h2><p class="psasuper">For the music director, according to the <i>machalath</i> style; a well-written song by David.</p><p class="poetry"><span class="verse">53:1</span> Fools say to themselves, “There is no God.” </p>
<p class="poetry">They sin and commit evil deeds; </p>
<p class="poetry">none of them does what is right. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">53:2</span> God looks down from heaven at the human race, </p>
<p class="poetry">to see if there is anyone who is wise and seeks God. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">53:3</span> Everyone rejects God; </p>
<p class="poetry">they are all morally corrupt. </p>
<p class="poetry">None of them does what is right, </p>
<p class="poetry">not even one! </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">53:4</span> All those who behave wickedly do not understand —</p>
<p class="poetry">those who devour my people as if they were eating bread,</p>
<p class="poetry">and do not call out to God. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">53:5</span> They are absolutely terrified, </p>
<p class="poetry">even by things that do not normally cause fear. </p>
<p class="poetry">For God annihilates those who attack you. </p>
<p class="poetry">You are able to humiliate them because God has rejected them. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">53:6</span> I wish the deliverance of Israel would come from Zion!</p>
<p class="poetry">When God restores the well-being of his people, </p>
<p class="poetry">may Jacob rejoice, </p>
<p class="poetry">may Israel be happy! </p>
