<h2>Psalm 115</h2><p class="poetry"><span class="verse">115:1</span> Not to us, O <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, not to us,</p>
<p class="poetry">but to your name bring honor, </p>
<p class="poetry">for the sake of your loyal love and faithfulness. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">115:2</span> Why should the nations say,</p>
<p class="poetry">“Where is their God?” </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">115:3</span> Our God is in heaven.</p>
<p class="poetry">He does whatever he pleases. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">115:4</span> Their idols are made of silver and gold—</p>
<p class="poetry">they are man-made. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">115:5</span> They have mouths, but cannot speak,</p>
<p class="poetry">eyes, but cannot see, </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">115:6</span> ears, but cannot hear,</p>
<p class="poetry">noses, but cannot smell, </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">115:7</span> hands, but cannot touch,</p>
<p class="poetry">feet, but cannot walk.</p>
<p class="poetry">They cannot even clear their throats. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">115:8</span> Those who make them will end up like them,</p>
<p class="poetry">as will everyone who trusts in them.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">115:9</span> O Israel, trust in the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="poetry">He is their deliverer and protector. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">115:10</span> O family of Aaron, trust in the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="poetry">He is their deliverer and protector. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">115:11</span> You loyal followers of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, trust in the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="poetry">He is their deliverer and protector. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">115:12</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> takes notice of us; he will bless —</p>
<p class="poetry">he will bless the family of Israel,</p>
<p class="poetry">he will bless the family of Aaron. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">115:13</span> He will bless his loyal followers, </p>
<p class="poetry">both young and old. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">115:14</span> May he increase your numbers,</p>
<p class="poetry">yours and your children’s. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">115:15</span> May you be blessed by the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>,</p>
<p class="poetry">the Creator of heaven and earth. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">115:16</span> The heavens belong to the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, </p>
<p class="poetry">but the earth he has given to mankind. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">115:17</span> The dead do not praise the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>,</p>
<p class="poetry">nor do any of those who descend into the silence of death. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">115:18</span> But we will praise the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span></p>
<p class="poetry">now and forevermore.</p>
<p class="poetry">Praise the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>! </p>
