<h2>Psalm 120</h2><p class="psasuper">A song of ascents. </p><p class="poetry"><span class="verse">120:1</span> In my distress I cried out</p>
<p class="poetry">to the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> and he answered me.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">120:2</span> I said, “O <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, rescue me </p>
<p class="poetry">from those who lie with their lips </p>
<p class="poetry">and those who deceive with their tongues. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">120:3</span> How will he severely punish you,</p>
<p class="poetry">you deceptive talker? </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">120:4</span> Here’s how! With the sharp arrows of warriors,</p>
<p class="poetry">with arrowheads forged over the hot coals. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">120:5</span> How miserable I am. </p>
<p class="poetry">For I have lived temporarily in Meshech;</p>
<p class="poetry">I have resided among the tents of Kedar. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">120:6</span> For too long I have had to reside</p>
<p class="poetry">with those who hate peace. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">120:7</span> I am committed to peace, </p>
<p class="poetry">but when I speak, they want to make war. </p>
