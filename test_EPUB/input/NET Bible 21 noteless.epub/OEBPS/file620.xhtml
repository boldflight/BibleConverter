<h2>Psalm 123</h2><p class="psasuper">A song of ascents. </p><p class="poetry"><span class="verse">123:1</span> I look up toward you,</p>
<p class="poetry">the one enthroned in heaven. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">123:2</span> Look, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master,</p>
<p class="poetry">as the eyes of a female servant look to the hand of her mistress, </p>
<p class="poetry">so our eyes will look to the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, our God, until he shows us favor.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">123:3</span> Show us favor, O <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, show us favor!</p>
<p class="poetry">For we have had our fill of humiliation, and then some. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">123:4</span> We have had our fill </p>
<p class="poetry">of the taunts of the self-assured,</p>
<p class="poetry">of the contempt of the proud. </p>
