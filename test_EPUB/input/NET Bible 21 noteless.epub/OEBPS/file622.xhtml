<h2>Psalm 125</h2><p class="psasuper">A song of ascents. </p><p class="poetry"><span class="verse">125:1</span> Those who trust in the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> are like Mount Zion,</p>
<p class="poetry">which cannot be moved and will endure forever. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">125:2</span> As the mountains surround Jerusalem, </p>
<p class="poetry">so the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> surrounds his people,</p>
<p class="poetry">now and forevermore. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">125:3</span> Indeed, the scepter of a wicked king will not settle </p>
<p class="poetry">upon the allotted land of the godly.</p>
<p class="poetry">Otherwise the godly </p>
<p class="poetry">might do what is wrong. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">125:4</span> Do good, O <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, to those who are good,</p>
<p class="poetry">to the morally upright. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">125:5</span> As for those who are bent on traveling a sinful path, </p>
<p class="poetry">may the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> remove them, along with those who behave wickedly. </p>
<p class="poetry">May Israel experience peace. </p>
