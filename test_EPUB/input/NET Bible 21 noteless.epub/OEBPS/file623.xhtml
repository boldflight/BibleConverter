<h2>Psalm 126</h2><p class="psasuper">A song of ascents. </p><p class="poetry"><span class="verse">126:1</span> When the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> restored the well-being of Zion, </p>
<p class="poetry">we thought we were dreaming. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">126:2</span> At that time we laughed loudly</p>
<p class="poetry">and shouted for joy. </p>
<p class="poetry">At that time the nations said, </p>
<p class="poetry">“The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> has accomplished great things for these people.”</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">126:3</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> did indeed accomplish great things for us.</p>
<p class="poetry">We were happy. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">126:4</span> O <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, restore our well-being,</p>
<p class="poetry">just as the streams in the arid south are replenished. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">126:5</span> Those who shed tears as they plant</p>
<p class="poetry">will shout for joy when they reap the harvest. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">126:6</span> The one who weeps as he walks along, carrying his bag of seed,</p>
<p class="poetry">will certainly come in with a shout of joy, carrying his sheaves of grain. </p>
