<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">135:2</span> who serve in the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s temple,</p>
<p class="poetry">in the courts of the temple of our God. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">135:3</span> Praise the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, for the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> is good.</p>
<p class="poetry">Sing praises to his name, for it is pleasant. </p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">135:7</span> He causes the clouds to arise from the end of the earth,</p>

<p class="poetry">against Pharaoh and all his servants. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">135:10</span> He defeated many nations,</p>
<p class="poetry">and killed mighty kings—</p>

<p class="poetry">and all the kingdoms of Canaan. </p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">135:13</span> O <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, your name endures, </p>

<p class="poetry">and has compassion on his servants. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">135:15</span> The nations’ idols are made of silver and gold;</p>
<p class="poetry">they are man-made. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">135:16</span> They have mouths, but cannot speak,</p>
<p class="poetry">eyes, but cannot see, </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">135:17</span> and ears, but cannot hear.</p>
<p class="poetry">Indeed, they cannot breathe. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">135:18</span> Those who make them will end up like them,</p>
<p class="poetry">as will everyone who trusts in them.</p>
