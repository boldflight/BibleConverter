<h2>Psalm 137</h2><p class="poetry"><span class="verse">137:1</span> By the rivers of Babylon</p>
<p class="poetry">we sit down and weep </p>
<p class="poetry">when we remember Zion. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">137:2</span> On the poplars in her midst</p>
<p class="poetry">we hang our harps, </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">137:3</span> for there our captors ask us to compose songs; </p>
<p class="poetry">those who mock us demand that we be happy, saying: </p>
<p class="poetry">“Sing for us a song about Zion!” </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">137:4</span> How can we sing a song to the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span></p>
<p class="poetry">in a foreign land? </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">137:5</span> If I forget you, O Jerusalem,</p>
<p class="poetry">may my right hand be crippled. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">137:6</span> May my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth,</p>
<p class="poetry">if I do not remember you,</p>
<p class="poetry">and do not give Jerusalem priority</p>
<p class="poetry">over whatever gives me the most joy. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">137:7</span> Remember, O <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, what the Edomites did</p>
<p class="poetry">on the day Jerusalem fell. </p>
<p class="poetry">They said, “Tear it down, tear it down, </p>
<p class="poetry">right to its very foundation!” </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">137:8</span> O daughter Babylon, soon to be devastated, </p>
<p class="poetry">how blessed will be the one who repays you</p>
<p class="poetry">for what you dished out to us. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">137:9</span> How blessed will be the one who grabs your babies</p>
<p class="poetry">and smashes them on a rock. </p>
