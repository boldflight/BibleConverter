<p class="poetry">I tell him about my troubles. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">142:3</span> Even when my strength leaves me, </p>
<p class="poetry">you watch my footsteps. </p>
<p class="poetry">In the path where I walk</p>
<p class="poetry">they have hidden a trap for me.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">142:4</span> Look to the right and see.</p>
