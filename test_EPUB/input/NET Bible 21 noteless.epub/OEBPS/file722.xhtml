<h1>Isaiah<br />Chapter 20</h1>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">20:1</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> revealed the following message during the year in which King Sargon of Assyria sent his commanding general to Ashdod, and he fought against it and captured it. <span class="verse">20:2</span> At that time the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> announced through Isaiah son of Amoz: “Go, remove the sackcloth from your waist and take your sandals off your feet.” He did as instructed and walked around in undergarments and barefoot. <span class="verse">20:3</span> Later the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> explained, “In the same way that my servant Isaiah has walked around in undergarments and barefoot for the past three years, as an object lesson and omen pertaining to Egypt and Cush, <span class="verse">20:4</span> so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Cush, both young and old. They will be in undergarments and barefoot, with the buttocks exposed; the Egyptians will be publicly humiliated. <span class="verse">20:5</span> Those who put their hope in Cush and took pride in Egypt will be afraid and embarrassed. <span class="verse">20:6</span> At that time those who live on this coast will say, ‘Look what has happened to our source of hope to whom we fled for help, expecting to be rescued from the king of Assyria! How can we escape now?’”</p>
