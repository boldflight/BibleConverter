<h1>Isaiah<br />Chapter 39</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Messengers from Babylon Visit Hezekiah</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">39:1</span> At that time Merodach Baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he heard that Hezekiah had been ill and had recovered. <span class="verse">39:2</span> Hezekiah welcomed them and showed them his storehouse with its silver, gold, spices, and high-quality olive oil, as well as his whole armory and everything in his treasuries. Hezekiah showed them everything in his palace and in his whole kingdom. <span class="verse">39:3</span> Isaiah the prophet visited King Hezekiah and asked him, “What did these men say? Where do they come from?” Hezekiah replied, “They come from the distant land of Babylon.” <span class="verse">39:4</span> Isaiah asked, “What have they seen in your palace?” Hezekiah replied, “They have seen everything in my palace. I showed them everything in my treasuries.” <span class="verse">39:5</span> Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Listen to the message of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies: <span class="verse">39:6</span> ‘Look, a time is coming when everything in your palace and the things your ancestors have accumulated to this day will be carried away to Babylon; nothing will be left,’ says the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse">39:7</span> ‘Some of your very own descendants whom you father will be taken away and will be made eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.’” <span class="verse">39:8</span> Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s message that you have announced is appropriate.” Then he thought, “For there will be peace and stability during my lifetime.” </p>
