<h1>Ezekiel<br />Chapter 1</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">A Vision of God’s Glory</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1:1</span> In the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month, while I was among the exiles at the Kebar River, the heavens opened and I saw a divine vision. <span class="verse">1:2</span> (On the fifth day of the month—it was the fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s exile— <span class="verse">1:3</span> the <span class="smcaps">Lord’</span>s message came to the priest Ezekiel the son of Buzi, at the Kebar River in the land of the Babylonians. The hand of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> came on him there.) </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1:4</span> As I watched, I noticed a windstorm coming from the north—an enormous cloud, with lightning flashing, such that bright light rimmed it and came from it like glowing amber from the middle of a fire. <span class="verse">1:5</span> In the fire were what looked like four living beings. In their appearance they had human form, <span class="verse">1:6</span> but each had four faces and four wings. <span class="verse">1:7</span> Their legs were straight, but the soles of their feet were like calves’ feet. They gleamed like polished bronze. <span class="verse">1:8</span> They had human hands under their wings on their four sides. As for the faces and wings of the four of them, <span class="verse">1:9</span> their wings touched each other; they did not turn as they moved, but went straight ahead. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1:10</span> Their faces had this appearance: Each of the four had the face of a man, with the face of a lion on the right, the face of an ox on the left, and also the face of an eagle. <span class="verse">1:11</span> Their wings were spread out above them; each had two wings touching the wings of one of the other beings on either side and two wings covering their bodies. <span class="verse">1:12</span> Each moved straight ahead —wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went. <span class="verse">1:13</span> In the middle of the living beings was something like burning coals of fire or like torches. It moved back and forth among the living beings. It was bright, and lightning was flashing out of the fire. <span class="verse">1:14</span> The living beings moved backward and forward as quickly as flashes of lightning. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1:15</span> Then I looked, and I saw one wheel on the ground beside each of the four beings. <span class="verse">1:16</span> The appearance of the wheels and their construction was like gleaming jasper, and all four wheels looked alike. Their structure was like a wheel within a wheel. <span class="verse">1:17</span> When they moved they would go in any of the four directions they faced without turning as they moved. <span class="verse">1:18</span> Their rims were high and awesome, and the rims of all four wheels were full of eyes all around. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1:19</span> When the living beings moved, the wheels beside them moved; when the living beings rose up from the ground, the wheels rose up too. <span class="verse">1:20</span> Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise up beside them because the spirit of the living being was in the wheel. <span class="verse">1:21</span> When the living beings moved, the wheels moved, and when they stopped moving, the wheels stopped. When they rose up from the ground, the wheels rose up from the ground; the wheels rose up beside them because the spirit of the living being was in the wheel. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1:22</span> Over the heads of the living beings was something like a platform, glittering awesomely like ice, stretched out over their heads. <span class="verse">1:23</span> Under the platform their wings were stretched out, each toward the other. Each of the beings also had two wings covering its body. <span class="verse">1:24</span> When they moved, I heard the sound of their wings—it was like the sound of rushing waters, or the voice of the Sovereign One, or the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1:25</span> Then there was a voice from above the platform over their heads when they stood still. <span class="verse">1:26</span> Above the platform over their heads was something like a sapphire shaped like a throne. High above on the throne was a form that appeared to be a man. <span class="verse">1:27</span> I saw an amber glow like a fire enclosed all around from his waist up. From his waist down I saw something that looked like fire. There was a brilliant light around it, <span class="verse">1:28</span> like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds after the rain. This was the appearance of the surrounding brilliant light; it looked like the glory of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>. When I saw it, I threw myself face down, and I heard a voice speaking. </p>
