<h1>Hosea<br />Chapter 3</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">An Illustration of God’s Love for Idolatrous Israel</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">3:1</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> said to me, “Go, show love to your wife again, even though she loves another man and continually commits adultery. Likewise, the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> loves the Israelites although they turn to other gods and love to offer raisin cakes to idols.” <span class="verse">3:2</span> So I paid fifteen shekels of silver and about seven bushels of barley to purchase her. <span class="verse">3:3</span> Then I told her, “You must live with me many days; you must not commit adultery or become joined to another man, and I also will wait for you.” <span class="verse">3:4</span> For the Israelites must live many days without a king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred fertility pillar, without ephod or idols. <span class="verse">3:5</span> Afterward, the Israelites will turn and seek the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> their God and their Davidic king. Then they will submit to the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> in fear and receive his blessings in future days. </p>
