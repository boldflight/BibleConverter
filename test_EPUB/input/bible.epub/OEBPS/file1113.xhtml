<h1>1 Corinthians<br />Chapter 5</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Church Discipline</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">5:1</span> It is actually reported that sexual immorality exists among you, the kind of immorality that is not permitted even among the Gentiles, so that someone is cohabiting with his father’s wife. <span class="verse">5:2</span> And you are proud! Shouldn’t you have been deeply sorrowful instead and removed the one who did this from among you? <span class="verse">5:3</span> For even though I am absent physically, I am present in spirit. And I have already judged the one who did this, just as though I were present. <span class="verse">5:4</span> When you gather together in the name of our Lord Jesus, and I am with you in spirit, along with the power of our Lord Jesus, <span class="verse">5:5</span> hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">5:6</span> Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know that a little yeast affects the whole batch of dough? <span class="verse">5:7</span> Clean out the old yeast so that you may be a new batch of dough—you are, in fact, without yeast. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. <span class="verse">5:8</span> So then, let us celebrate the festival, not with the old yeast, the yeast of vice and evil, but with the bread without yeast, the bread of sincerity and truth. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">5:9</span> I wrote you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people. <span class="verse">5:10</span> In no way did I mean the immoral people of this world, or the greedy and swindlers and idolaters, since you would then have to go out of the world. <span class="verse">5:11</span> But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who calls himself a Christian who is sexually immoral, or greedy, or an idolater, or verbally abusive, or a drunkard, or a swindler. Do not even eat with such a person. <span class="verse">5:12</span> For what do I have to do with judging those outside? Are you not to judge those inside? <span class="verse">5:13</span> But God will judge those outside. <i>Remove</i> <i>the evil person from among you</i>. </p>
