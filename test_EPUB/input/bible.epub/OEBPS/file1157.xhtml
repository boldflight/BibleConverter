<h1>Philippians<br />Chapter 4</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Christian Practices</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">4:1</span> So then, my brothers and sisters, dear friends whom I long to see, my joy and crown, stand in the Lord in this way, my dear friends! </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">4:2</span> I appeal to Euodia and to Syntyche to agree in the Lord. <span class="verse">4:3</span> Yes, I say also to you, true companion, help them. They have struggled together in the gospel ministry along with me and Clement and my other coworkers, whose names are in the book of life. <span class="verse">4:4</span> Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I say, rejoice! <span class="verse">4:5</span> Let everyone see your gentleness. The Lord is near! <span class="verse">4:6</span> Do not be anxious about anything. Instead, in every situation, through prayer and petition with thanksgiving, tell your requests to God. <span class="verse">4:7</span> And the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">4:8</span> Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is worthy of respect, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if something is excellent or praiseworthy, think about these things. <span class="verse">4:9</span> And what you learned and received and heard and saw in me, do these things. And the God of peace will be with you. </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Appreciation for Support</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">4:10</span> I have great joy in the Lord because now at last you have again expressed your concern for me. (Now I know you were concerned before but had no opportunity to do anything.) <span class="verse">4:11</span> I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content in any circumstance. <span class="verse">4:12</span> I have experienced times of need and times of abundance. In any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of contentment, whether I go satisfied or hungry, have plenty or nothing. <span class="verse">4:13</span> I am able to do all things through the one who strengthens me. <span class="verse">4:14</span> Nevertheless, you did well to share with me in my trouble. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">4:15</span> And as you Philippians know, at the beginning of my gospel ministry, when I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in this matter of giving and receiving except you alone. <span class="verse">4:16</span> For even in Thessalonica on more than one occasion you sent something for my need. <span class="verse">4:17</span> I do not say this because I am seeking a gift. Rather, I seek the credit that abounds to your account. <span class="verse">4:18</span> For I have received everything, and I have plenty. I have all I need because I received from Epaphroditus what you sent—a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, very pleasing to God. <span class="verse">4:19</span> And my God will supply your every need according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus. <span class="verse">4:20</span> May glory be given to God our Father forever and ever. Amen. </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Final Greetings</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">4:21</span> Give greetings to all the saints in Christ Jesus. The brothers with me here send greetings. <span class="verse">4:22</span> All the saints greet you, especially those who belong to Caesar’s household. <span class="verse">4:23</span> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. </p>
