<h1>1 Timothy<br />Chapter 4</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Timothy’s Ministry in the Later Times</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">4:1</span> Now the Spirit explicitly says that in the later times some will desert the faith and occupy themselves with deceiving spirits and demonic teachings, <span class="verse">4:2</span> influenced by the hypocrisy of liars whose consciences are seared. <span class="verse">4:3</span> They will prohibit marriage and require abstinence from foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth. <span class="verse">4:4</span> For every creation of God is good and no food is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving. <span class="verse">4:5</span> For it is sanctified by God’s word and by prayer. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">4:6</span> By pointing out such things to the brothers and sisters, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, having nourished yourself on the words of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed. <span class="verse">4:7</span> But reject those myths fit only for the godless and gullible, and train yourself for godliness. <span class="verse">4:8</span> For “physical exercise has some value, but godliness is valuable in every way. It holds promise for the present life and for the life to come.” <span class="verse">4:9</span> This saying is trustworthy and deserves full acceptance. <span class="verse">4:10</span> In fact this is why we work hard and struggle, because we have set our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of believers. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">4:11</span> Command and teach these things. <span class="verse">4:12</span> Let no one look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in your speech, conduct, love, faithfulness, and purity. <span class="verse">4:13</span> Until I come, give attention to the public reading of scripture, to exhortation, to teaching. <span class="verse">4:14</span> Do not neglect the spiritual gift you have, given to you and confirmed by prophetic words when the elders laid hands on you. <span class="verse">4:15</span> Take pains with these things; be absorbed in them, so that everyone will see your progress. <span class="verse">4:16</span> Be conscientious about how you live and what you teach. Persevere in this, because by doing so you will save both yourself and those who listen to you. </p>
