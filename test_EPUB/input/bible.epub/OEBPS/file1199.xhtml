<h1>Hebrews<br />Chapter 8</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">The High Priest of a Better Covenant</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">8:1</span> Now the main point of what we are saying is this: We have such a high priest, one who <i>sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven</i>, <span class="verse">8:2</span> a minister in the sanctuary and the true tabernacle that the Lord, not man, set up. <span class="verse">8:3</span> For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. So this one too had to have something to offer. <span class="verse">8:4</span> Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest, since there are already priests who offer the gifts prescribed by the law. <span class="verse">8:5</span> The place where they serve is a sketch and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary, just as Moses was warned by God as he was about to complete the tabernacle. For he says, “<b><i>See that you make everything according to the design</i></b> <b><i>shown</i> <i>to you on the mountain</i></b>.” <span class="verse">8:6</span> But now Jesus has obtained a superior ministry, since the covenant that he mediates is also better and is enacted on better promises. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">8:7</span> For if that first covenant had been faultless, no one would have looked for a second one. <span class="verse">8:8</span> But showing its fault, God says to them, </p>
<p class="otpoetry">“<i><b>Look, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will complete a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah</b></i>.</p>
<p class="otpoetry"><span class="verse">8:9</span> “<b><i>It will not be like the covenant</i></b> <i><b>that I made with their fathers, on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they did not continue in my covenant and I had no regard for them, says the Lord</b></i>.</p>
<p class="otpoetry"><span class="verse">8:10</span> “<i><b>For this is the covenant that I will establish with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord</b>. <b>I will put</b></i> <b><i>my</i> <i>laws in their minds</i></b> <i><b>and I will inscribe them on their hearts</b>. <b>And I will be their God and they will be my people</b></i>. </p>
<p class="otpoetry"><span class="verse">8:11</span> “<b><i>And there will be no need at all</i></b> <i><b>for each one to teach his countryman or each one to teach his brother saying</b></i>, ‘<i><b>Know the Lord</b>,</i>’ <i><b>since they will all know me, from the least to the greatest</b></i>. </p>
<p class="otpoetry"><span class="verse">8:12</span> “<i><b>For I will be merciful toward their evil deeds, and their sins I will remember no longer</b></i>.” </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">8:13</span> When he speaks of a new covenant, he makes the first obsolete. Now what is growing obsolete and aging is about to disappear. </p>
