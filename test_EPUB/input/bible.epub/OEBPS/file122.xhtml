<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1:17</span> So Moses and Aaron took these men who had been mentioned specifically by name, <span class="verse">1:18</span> and they assembled the entire community together on the first day of the second month. Then the people recorded their ancestry by their clans and families, and the men who were twenty years old or older were listed by name individually, <span class="verse">1:19</span> just as the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.

<p class="paragraphtitle">The Exemption of the Levites</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1:47</span> But the Levites, according to the tribe of their fathers, were not numbered among them. <span class="verse">1:48</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> had said to Moses, <span class="verse">1:49</span> “Only the tribe of Levi you must not number or count with the other Israelites. <span class="verse">1:50</span> But appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, over all its furnishings and over everything in it. They must carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings; and they must attend to it and camp around it. <span class="verse">1:51</span> Whenever the tabernacle is to move, the Levites must take it down, and whenever the tabernacle is to be reassembled, the Levites must set it up. Any unauthorized person who approaches it must be killed. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1:52</span> “The Israelites will camp according to their divisions, each man in his camp, and each man by his standard. <span class="verse">1:53</span> But the Levites must camp around the tabernacle of the testimony, so that the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s anger will not fall on the Israelite community. The Levites are responsible for the care of the tabernacle of the testimony.” </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1:54</span> The Israelites did according to all that the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> commanded Moses —that is what they did. </p>
