<h1>Revelation<br />Chapter 1</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">The Prologue</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1:1</span> The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants what must happen very soon. He made it clear by sending his angel to his servant John, <span class="verse">1:2</span> who then testified to everything that he saw concerning the word of God and the testimony about Jesus Christ. <span class="verse">1:3</span> Blessed is the one who reads the words of this prophecy aloud, and blessed are those who hear and obey the things written in it, because the time is near! </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1:4</span> From John, to the seven churches that are in the province of Asia: Grace and peace to you from “he who is,” and who was, and who is still to come, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne, <span class="verse">1:5</span> and from Jesus Christ—the faithful witness, the firstborn from among the dead, the ruler over the kings of the earth. To the one who loves us and has set us free from our sins at the cost of his own blood <span class="verse">1:6</span> and has appointed us as a kingdom, as priests serving his God and Father—to him be the glory and the power for ever and ever! Amen. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">1:7</span> (Look! <i>He is returning with the clouds</i>, </p>
<p class="poetry">and <i>every</i> <i>eye will see him,</i></p>
<p class="poetry"><i>even</i> <i>those who pierced him</i>, </p>
<p class="poetry">and all the tribes on the earth will mourn because of him.</p>
<p class="poetry">This will certainly come to pass! Amen.) </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1:8</span> “I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God—the one who is, and who was, and who is still to come—the All-Powerful! </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1:9</span> I, John, your brother and the one who shares with you in the persecution, kingdom, and endurance that are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony about Jesus. <span class="verse">1:10</span> I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s Day when I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet, <span class="verse">1:11</span> saying: “Write in a book what you see and send it to the seven churches—to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.” </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1:12</span> I turned to see whose voice was speaking to me, and when I did so, I saw seven golden lampstands, <span class="verse">1:13</span> and in the midst of the lampstands was one <i>like</i> <i>a son of man</i>. He was dressed in a robe extending down to his feet and he wore a wide golden belt around his chest. <span class="verse">1:14</span> His head and hair were as white as wool, even as white as snow, and his eyes were like a fiery flame. <span class="verse">1:15</span> His feet were like polished bronze refined in a furnace, and his voice was like the roar of many waters. <span class="verse">1:16</span> He held seven stars in his right hand, and a sharp double-edged sword extended out of his mouth. His face shone like the sun shining at full strength. <span class="verse">1:17</span> When I saw him I fell down at his feet as though I were dead, but he placed his right hand on me and said: “Do not be afraid! I am the first and the last, <span class="verse">1:18</span> and the one who lives! I was dead, but look, now I am alive—forever and ever—and I hold the keys of death and of Hades! <span class="verse">1:19</span> Therefore write what you saw, what is, and what will be after these things. <span class="verse">1:20</span> The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and the seven golden lampstands is this: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven lampstands are the seven churches. </p>
