<h1>Revelation<br />Chapter 9</h1>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">9:1</span> Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth, and he was given the key to the shaft of the abyss. <span class="verse">9:2</span> He opened the shaft of the abyss and smoke rose out of it like smoke from a giant furnace. The sun and the air were darkened with smoke from the shaft. <span class="verse">9:3</span> Then out of the smoke came locusts onto the earth, and they were given power like that of the scorpions of the earth. <span class="verse">9:4</span> They were told not to damage the grass of the earth, or any green plant or tree, but only those people who did not have the seal of God on their forehead. <span class="verse">9:5</span> The locusts were not given permission to kill them, but only to torture them for five months, and their torture was like that of a scorpion when it stings a person. <span class="verse">9:6</span> In those days people will seek death, but will not be able to find it; they will long to die, but death will flee from them. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">9:7</span> Now the locusts looked like horses equipped for battle. On their heads were something like crowns similar to gold, and their faces looked like men’s faces. <span class="verse">9:8</span> They had hair like women’s hair, and their teeth were like lions’ teeth. <span class="verse">9:9</span> They had breastplates like iron breastplates, and the sound of their wings was like the noise of many horse-drawn chariots charging into battle. <span class="verse">9:10</span> They have tails and stingers like scorpions, and their ability to injure people for five months is in their tails. <span class="verse">9:11</span> They have as king over them the angel of the abyss, whose name in Hebrew is <i>Abaddon</i>, and in Greek, <i>Apollyon</i>. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">9:12</span> The first woe has passed, but two woes are still coming after these things! </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">9:13</span> Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet, and I heard a single voice coming from the horns on the golden altar that is before God, <span class="verse">9:14</span> saying to the sixth angel, the one holding the trumpet, “Set free the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates!” <span class="verse">9:15</span> Then the four angels who had been prepared for this hour, day, month, and year were set free to kill a third of humanity. <span class="verse">9:16</span> The number of soldiers on horseback was 200,000,000; I heard their number. <span class="verse">9:17</span> Now this is what the horses and their riders looked like in my vision: The riders had breastplates that were fiery red, dark blue, and sulfurous yellow in color. The heads of the horses looked like lions’ heads, and fire, smoke, and sulfur came out of their mouths. <span class="verse">9:18</span> A third of humanity was killed by these three plagues, that is, by the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur that came out of their mouths. <span class="verse">9:19</span> For the power of the horses resides in their mouths and in their tails, because their tails are like snakes, having heads that inflict injuries. <span class="verse">9:20</span> The rest of humanity, who had not been killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, so that they did not stop worshiping demons and idols made of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood—idols that cannot see or hear or walk about. <span class="verse">9:21</span> Furthermore, they did not repent of their murders, of their magic spells, of their sexual immorality, or of their stealing. </p>
