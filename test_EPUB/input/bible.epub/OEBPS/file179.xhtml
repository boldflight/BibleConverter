<h1>Deuteronomy<br />Chapter 21</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Laws Concerning Unsolved Murder</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">21:1</span> If a homicide victim should be found lying in a field in the land the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> your God is giving you, and no one knows who killed him, <span class="verse">21:2</span> your elders and judges must go out and measure how far it is to the cities in the vicinity of the corpse. <span class="verse">21:3</span> Then the elders of the city nearest to the corpse must take from the herd a heifer that has not been worked—that has never pulled with the yoke— <span class="verse">21:4</span> and bring the heifer down to a wadi with flowing water, to a valley that is neither plowed nor sown. There at the wadi they are to break the heifer’s neck. <span class="verse">21:5</span> Then the Levitical priests will approach (for the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> your God has chosen them to serve him and to pronounce blessings in his name, and to decide every judicial verdict) , <span class="verse">21:6</span> and all the elders of that city nearest the corpse must wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley. <span class="verse">21:7</span> Then they must proclaim, “Our hands have not spilled this blood, nor have we witnessed the crime. <span class="verse">21:8</span> Do not blame your people Israel whom you redeemed, O <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, and do not hold them accountable for the bloodshed of an innocent person.” Then atonement will be made for the bloodshed. <span class="verse">21:9</span> In this manner you will purge the guilt of innocent blood from among you, for you must do what is right before the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>. </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Laws Concerning Female Captives</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">21:10</span> When you go out to do battle with your enemies and the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> your God allows you to prevail and you take prisoners, <span class="verse">21:11</span> if you should see among them an attractive woman whom you wish to take as a wife, <span class="verse">21:12</span> you may bring her back to your house. She must shave her head, trim her nails, <span class="verse">21:13</span> discard the clothing she was wearing when captured, and stay in your house, lamenting for her father and mother for a full month. After that you may sleep with her and become her husband and she your wife. <span class="verse">21:14</span> If you are not pleased with her, then you must let her go where she pleases. You cannot in any case sell her; you must not take advantage of her, since you have already humiliated her.</p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Laws Concerning Children</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">21:15</span> Suppose a man has two wives, one whom he loves more than the other, and they both bear him sons, with the firstborn being the child of the less-loved wife. <span class="verse">21:16</span> In the day he divides his inheritance he must not appoint as firstborn the son of the favorite wife in place of the other wife’s son who is actually the firstborn. <span class="verse">21:17</span> Rather, he must acknowledge the son of the less-loved wife as firstborn and give him the double portion of all he has, for that son is the beginning of his father’s procreative power —to him should go the right of the firstborn. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">21:18</span> If a person has a stubborn, rebellious son who pays no attention to his father or mother, and they discipline him to no avail, <span class="verse">21:19</span> his father and mother must seize him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his city. <span class="verse">21:20</span> They must declare to the elders of his city, “Our son is stubborn and rebellious and pays no attention to what we say—he is a glutton and drunkard.” <span class="verse">21:21</span> Then all the men of his city must stone him to death. In this way you will purge wickedness from among you, and all Israel will hear about it and be afraid. </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Disposition of a Criminal’s Remains</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">21:22</span> If a person commits a sin punishable by death and is executed, and you hang the corpse on a tree, <span class="verse">21:23</span> his body must not remain all night on the tree; instead you must make certain you bury him that same day, for the one who is left exposed on a tree is cursed by God. You must not defile your land that the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> your God is giving you as an inheritance. </p>
