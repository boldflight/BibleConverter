<h1>2 Kings<br />Chapter 24</h1>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">24:1</span> During Jehoiakim’s reign, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon attacked. Jehoiakim was his subject for three years, but then he rebelled against him. <span class="verse">24:2</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> sent against him Babylonian, Syrian, Moabite, and Ammonite raiding bands; he sent them to destroy Judah, just as in the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s message that he had announced through his servants the prophets. <span class="verse">24:3</span> Just as the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> had announced, he rejected Judah because of all the sins that Manasseh had committed. <span class="verse">24:4</span> Because he killed innocent people and stained Jerusalem with their blood, the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> was unwilling to forgive them. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">24:5</span> The rest of the events of Jehoiakim’s reign and all his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Judah. <span class="verse">24:6</span> He passed away and his son Jehoiachin replaced him as king. <span class="verse">24:7</span> The king of Egypt did not march out from his land again, for the king of Babylon conquered all the territory that the king of Egypt had formerly controlled between the Stream of Egypt and the Euphrates River. </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Jehoiachin’s Reign over Judah </p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">24:8</span> Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan, from Jerusalem. <span class="verse">24:9</span> He did evil in the sight of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> as his ancestors had done. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">24:10</span> At that time the generals of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon marched to Jerusalem and besieged the city. <span class="verse">24:11</span> King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came to the city while his generals were besieging it. <span class="verse">24:12</span> King Jehoiachin of Judah, along with his mother, his servants, his officials, and his eunuchs surrendered to the king of Babylon. The king of Babylon, in the eighth year of his reign, took Jehoiachin prisoner. <span class="verse">24:13</span> Nebuchadnezzar took from there all the riches in the treasuries of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s temple and of the royal palace. He removed all the gold items that King Solomon of Israel had made for the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s temple, just as the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> had warned. <span class="verse">24:14</span> He deported all the residents of Jerusalem, including all the officials and all the soldiers (10,000 people in all). This included all the craftsmen and those who worked with metal. No one was left except for the poorest among the people of the land. <span class="verse">24:15</span> He deported Jehoiachin from Jerusalem to Babylon, along with the king’s mother and wives, his eunuchs, and the high-ranking officials of the land. <span class="verse">24:16</span> The king of Babylon deported to Babylon all the soldiers (there were 7,000), as well as 1,000 craftsmen and metal workers. This included all the best warriors. <span class="verse">24:17</span> The king of Babylon made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin’s uncle, king in Jehoiachin’s place. He renamed him Zedekiah. </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Zedekiah’s Reign over Judah</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">24:18</span> Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he ruled for eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah, from Libnah. <span class="verse">24:19</span> He did evil in the sight of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, as Jehoiakim had done. </p>
