<h1>2 Chronicles<br />Chapter 21</h1>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">21:1</span> Jehoshaphat passed away and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. His son Jehoram replaced him as king. </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Jehoram’s Reign</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">21:2</span> His brothers, Jehoshaphat’s sons, were Azariah, Jechiel, Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael, and Shephatiah. All these were sons of King Jehoshaphat of Israel. <span class="verse">21:3</span> Their father gave them many presents, including silver, gold, and other precious items, along with fortified cities in Judah. But he gave the kingdom to Jehoram because he was the firstborn. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">21:4</span> Jehoram took control of his father’s kingdom and became powerful. Then he killed all his brothers, as well as some of the officials of Israel. <span class="verse">21:5</span> Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem. <span class="verse">21:6</span> He followed in the footsteps of the kings of Israel, just as Ahab’s dynasty had done, for he married Ahab’s daughter. He did evil in the sight of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse">21:7</span> But the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> was unwilling to destroy David’s dynasty because of the promise he had made to give David a perpetual dynasty. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">21:8</span> During Jehoram’s reign Edom freed themselves from Judah’s control and set up their own king. <span class="verse">21:9</span> Jehoram crossed over with his officers and all his chariots. The Edomites, who had surrounded him, attacked at night and defeated him and his chariot officers. <span class="verse">21:10</span> So Edom has remained free from Judah’s control to this very day. At that same time Libnah also rebelled and freed themselves from Judah’s control because Jehoram rejected the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> God of his ancestors. <span class="verse">21:11</span> He also built high places on the hills of Judah; he encouraged the residents of Jerusalem to be unfaithful to the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> and led Judah away from the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">21:12</span> Jehoram received this letter from Elijah the prophet: “This is what the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> God of your ancestor David says: ‘You have not followed in the footsteps of your father Jehoshaphat and of King Asa of Judah, <span class="verse">21:13</span> but have instead followed in the footsteps of the kings of Israel. You encouraged the people of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem to be unfaithful to the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, just as the family of Ahab does in Israel. You also killed your brothers, members of your father’s family, who were better than you. <span class="verse">21:14</span> So look, the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> is about to severely afflict your people, your sons, your wives, and all you own. <span class="verse">21:15</span> And you will get a serious, chronic intestinal disease which will cause your intestines to come out.’” </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">21:16</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> stirred up against Jehoram the Philistines and the Arabs who lived beside the Cushites. <span class="verse">21:17</span> They attacked Judah and swept through it. They carried off everything they found in the royal palace, including his sons and wives. None of his sons was left, except for his youngest, Ahaziah. <span class="verse">21:18</span> After all this happened, the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> afflicted him with an incurable intestinal disease. <span class="verse">21:19</span> After about two years his intestines came out because of the disease, so that he died a very painful death. His people did not make a bonfire to honor him, as they had done for his ancestors. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">21:20</span> Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. No one regretted his death; he was buried in the City of David, but not in the royal tombs. </p>
