<h2>Psalm 14</h2><p class="psasuper">For the music director, by David.</p><p class="poetry"><span class="verse">14:1</span> Fools say to themselves, “There is no God.” </p>
<p class="poetry">They sin and commit evil deeds; </p>
<p class="poetry">none of them does what is right. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">14:2</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> looks down from heaven at the human race, </p>
<p class="poetry">to see if there is anyone who is wise and seeks God. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">14:3</span> Everyone rejects God; </p>
<p class="poetry">they are all morally corrupt. </p>
<p class="poetry">None of them does what is right, </p>
<p class="poetry">not even one. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">14:4</span> All those who behave wickedly do not understand— </p>
<p class="poetry">those who devour my people as if they were eating bread,</p>
<p class="poetry">and do not call out to the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">14:5</span> They are absolutely terrified, </p>
<p class="poetry">for God defends the godly. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">14:6</span> You want to humiliate the oppressed, </p>
<p class="poetry">even though the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> is their shelter. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">14:7</span> I wish the deliverance of Israel would come from Zion!</p>
<p class="poetry">When the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> restores the well-being of his people, </p>
<p class="poetry">may Jacob rejoice, </p>
<p class="poetry">may Israel be happy! </p>
