<h2>Psalm 16</h2><p class="psasuper">A prayer of David.</p><p class="poetry"><span class="verse">16:1</span> Protect me, O God, for I have taken shelter in you. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">16:2</span> I say to the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, “You are the Lord,</p>
<p class="poetry">my only source of well-being.” </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">16:3</span> As for God’s chosen people who are in the land,</p>
<p class="poetry">and the leading officials I admired so much —</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">16:4</span> their troubles multiply;</p>
<p class="poetry">they desire other gods. </p>
<p class="poetry">I will not pour out drink offerings of blood to their gods, </p>
<p class="poetry">nor will I make vows in the name of their gods. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">16:5</span> <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, you give me stability and prosperity; </p>
<p class="poetry">you make my future secure. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">16:6</span> It is as if I have been given fertile fields</p>
<p class="poetry">or received a beautiful tract of land. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">16:7</span> I will praise the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> who guides me;</p>
<p class="poetry">yes, during the night I reflect and learn. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">16:8</span> I constantly trust in the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>; </p>
<p class="poetry">because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">16:9</span> So my heart rejoices</p>
<p class="poetry">and I am happy; </p>
<p class="poetry">my life is safe. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">16:10</span> You will not abandon me to Sheol; </p>
<p class="poetry">you will not allow your faithful follower to see the Pit. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">16:11</span> You lead me in the path of life. </p>
<p class="poetry">I experience absolute joy in your presence; </p>
<p class="poetry">you always give me sheer delight. </p>
