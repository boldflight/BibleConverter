<p class="poetry">Decide what is right. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">17:3</span> You have scrutinized my inner motives; </p>
<p class="poetry">you have examined me during the night. </p>
<p class="poetry">You have carefully evaluated me, but you find no sin.</p>
<p class="poetry">I am determined I will say nothing sinful. </p>

<p class="poetry">and leave their wealth to their offspring. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">17:15</span> As for me, because I am innocent I will see your face; </p>
<p class="poetry">when I awake you will reveal yourself to me. </p>
