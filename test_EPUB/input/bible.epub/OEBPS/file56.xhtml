<h1>Exodus<br />Chapter 4</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">The Source of Sufficiency</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">4:1</span>  Moses answered again, “And if they do not believe me or pay attention to me, but say, ‘The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> has not appeared to you’?” <span class="verse">4:2</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> said to him, “What is that in your hand?” He said, “A staff.” <span class="verse">4:3</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> said, “Throw it to the ground.” So he threw it to the ground, and it became a snake, and Moses ran from it. <span class="verse">4:4</span> But the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Put out your hand and grab it by the tail”—so he put out his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand — <span class="verse">4:5</span> “that they may believe that the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.”</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">4:6</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> also said to him, “Put your hand into your robe.” So he put his hand into his robe, and when he brought it out—there was his hand, leprous like snow! <span class="verse">4:7</span> He said, “Put your hand back into your robe.” So he put his hand back into his robe, and when he brought it out from his robe—there it was, restored like the rest of his skin! <span class="verse">4:8</span> “If they do not believe you or pay attention to the former sign, then they may believe the latter sign. <span class="verse">4:9</span> And if they do not believe even these two signs or listen to you, then take some water from the Nile and pour it out on the dry ground. The water you take out of the Nile will become blood on the dry ground.” </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">4:10</span> Then Moses said to the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, “O my Lord, I am not an eloquent man, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant, for I am slow of speech and slow of tongue.” </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">4:11</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> said to him, “Who gave a mouth to man, or who makes a person mute or deaf or seeing or blind? Is it not I, the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>? <span class="verse">4:12</span> So now go, and I will be with your mouth and will teach you what you must say.” </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">4:13</span> But Moses said, “O my Lord, please send anyone else whom you wish to send!” </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">4:14</span> Then the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> became angry with Moses, and he said, “What about your brother Aaron the Levite? I know that he can speak very well. Moreover, he is coming to meet you, and when he sees you he will be glad in his heart. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">4:15</span> “So you are to speak to him and put the words in his mouth. And as for me, I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and I will teach you both what you must do. <span class="verse">4:16</span> He will speak for you to the people, and it will be as if he were your mouth and as if you were his God. <span class="verse">4:17</span> You will also take in your hand this staff, with which you will do the signs.” </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">The Return of Moses </p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">4:18</span>  So Moses went back to his father-in-law Jethro and said to him, “Let me go, so that I may return to my relatives in Egypt and see if they are still alive.” Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.” <span class="verse">4:19</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt, because all the men who were seeking your life are dead.” <span class="verse">4:20</span> Then Moses took his wife and sons and put them on a donkey and headed back to the land of Egypt, and Moses took the staff of God in his hand. <span class="verse">4:21</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “When you go back to Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the wonders I have put under your control. But I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go. <span class="verse">4:22</span> You must say to Pharaoh, ‘This is what the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> has said, “Israel is my son, my firstborn, <span class="verse">4:23</span> and I said to you, ‘Let my son go that he may serve me,’ but since you have refused to let him go, I will surely kill your son, your firstborn!”’” </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">4:24</span> Now on the way, at a place where they stopped for the night, the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> met Moses and sought to kill him. <span class="verse">4:25</span> But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off the foreskin of her son and touched it to Moses’ feet, and said, “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me.” <span class="verse">4:26</span> So the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> let him alone. (At that time she said, “A bridegroom of blood,” referring to the circumcision.) </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">4:27</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> said to Aaron, “Go to the wilderness to meet Moses. So he went and met him at the mountain of God and greeted him with a kiss. <span class="verse">4:28</span> Moses told Aaron all the words of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> who had sent him and all the signs that he had commanded him. <span class="verse">4:29</span> Then Moses and Aaron went and brought together all the Israelite elders. <span class="verse">4:30</span> Aaron spoke all the words that the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> had spoken to Moses and did the signs in the sight of the people, <span class="verse">4:31</span> and the people believed. When they heard that the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> had attended to the Israelites and that he had seen their affliction, they bowed down close to the ground. </p>
