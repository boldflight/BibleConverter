<p class="poetry">people tell about your amazing deeds. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">75:2</span> God says, </p>

<p class="poetry">I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">75:10</span> God says, </p>
<p class="poetry">“I will bring down all the power of the wicked;</p>
<p class="poetry">the godly will be victorious.” </p>
