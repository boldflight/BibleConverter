<h2>Psalm 129</h2><p class="psasuper">A song of ascents. </p><p class="poetry"><span class="verse">129:1</span> “Since my youth they have often attacked me,”</p>
<p class="poetry">let Israel say. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">129:2</span> “Since my youth they have often attacked me,</p>
<p class="poetry">but they have not defeated me.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">129:3</span> The plowers plowed my back;</p>
<p class="poetry">they made their furrows long. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">129:4</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> is just;</p>
<p class="poetry">he cut the ropes of the wicked.” </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">129:5</span> May all who hate Zion</p>
<p class="poetry">be humiliated and turned back. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">129:6</span> May they be like the grass on the rooftops,</p>
<p class="poetry">which withers before one can even pull it up, </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">129:7</span> which cannot fill the reaper’s hand,</p>
<p class="poetry">or the lap of the one who gathers the grain. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">129:8</span> Those who pass by will not say, </p>
<p class="poetry">“May you experience the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s blessing!</p>
<p class="poetry">We pronounce a blessing on you in the name of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>.”</p>
