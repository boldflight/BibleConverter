<h2>Psalm 141</h2><p class="psasuper">A psalm of David.</p><p class="poetry"><span class="verse">141:1</span> O <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, I cry out to you. Come quickly to me.</p>
<p class="poetry">Pay attention to me when I cry out to you.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">141:2</span> May you accept my prayer like incense,</p>
<p class="poetry">my uplifted hands like the evening offering. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">141:3</span> O <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, place a guard on my mouth.</p>
<p class="poetry">Protect the opening of my lips. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">141:4</span> Do not let me have evil desires, </p>
<p class="poetry">or participate in sinful activities</p>
<p class="poetry">with men who behave wickedly. </p>
<p class="poetry">I will not eat their delicacies. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">141:5</span> May the godly strike me in love and correct me.</p>
<p class="poetry">May my head not refuse choice oil. </p>
<p class="poetry">Indeed, my prayer is a witness against their evil deeds. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">141:6</span> They will be thrown over the side of a cliff by their judges. </p>
<p class="poetry">They will listen to my words, for they are pleasant. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">141:7</span> As when one plows and breaks up the soil, </p>
<p class="poetry">so our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">141:8</span> Surely I am looking to you, O Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="poetry">In you I take shelter.</p>
<p class="poetry">Do not expose me to danger. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">141:9</span> Protect me from the snare they have laid for me,</p>
<p class="poetry">and the traps the evildoers have set. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">141:10</span> Let the wicked fall into their own nets,</p>
<p class="poetry">while I escape. </p>
