<h1>Isaiah<br />Chapter 4</h1>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">4:1</span> Seven women will grab hold of</p>
<p class="poetry">one man at that time. </p>
<p class="poetry">They will say, “We will provide our own food,</p>
<p class="poetry">we will provide our own clothes;</p>
<p class="poetry">but let us belong to you —</p>
<p class="poetry">take away our shame!” </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Cleansing and Protection from the Lord</p><p class="poetry"><span class="verse">4:2</span> At that time </p>
<p class="poetry">the crops given by the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> will bring admiration and honor; </p>
<p class="poetry">the produce of the land will be a source of pride and delight </p>
<p class="poetry">to those who remain in Israel. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">4:3</span> Those remaining in Zion, those left in Jerusalem, </p>
<p class="poetry">will be called “holy,” </p>
<p class="poetry">all in Jerusalem who are destined to live. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">4:4</span> At that time the Lord will wash the excrement from Zion’s women, </p>
<p class="poetry">he will rinse the bloodstains from Jerusalem’s midst, </p>
<p class="poetry">as he comes to judge</p>
<p class="poetry">and to bring devastation. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">4:5</span> Then the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> will create</p>
<p class="poetry">over all Mount Zion </p>
<p class="poetry">and over its convocations</p>
<p class="poetry">a cloud and smoke by day</p>
<p class="poetry">and a bright flame of fire by night; </p>
<p class="poetry">indeed a canopy will accompany the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s glorious presence. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">4:6</span> By day it will be a shelter to provide shade from the heat,</p>
<p class="poetry">as well as safety and protection from the heavy downpour. </p>
