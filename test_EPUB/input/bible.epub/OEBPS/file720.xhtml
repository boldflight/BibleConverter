<h1>Isaiah<br />Chapter 18</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">The Lord Will Judge a Distant Land in the South</p><p class="poetry"><span class="verse">18:1</span> Beware, land of buzzing wings, </p>
<p class="poetry">the one beyond the rivers of Cush, </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">18:2</span> that sends messengers by sea,</p>
<p class="poetry">who glide over the water’s surface in boats made of papyrus.</p>
<p class="poetry">Go, you swift messengers,</p>
<p class="poetry">to a nation of tall, smooth-skinned people, </p>
<p class="poetry">to a people that are feared far and wide, </p>
<p class="poetry">to a nation strong and victorious, </p>
<p class="poetry">whose land rivers divide. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">18:3</span> All you who live in the world,</p>
<p class="poetry">who reside on the earth,</p>
<p class="poetry">you will see a signal flag raised on the mountains;</p>
<p class="poetry">you will hear a trumpet being blown. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">18:4</span> For this is what the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> has told me:</p>
<p class="poetry">“I will wait and watch from my place,</p>
<p class="poetry">like scorching heat produced by the sunlight, </p>
<p class="poetry">like a cloud of mist in the heat of harvest.” </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">18:5</span> For before the harvest, when the bud has sprouted,</p>
<p class="poetry">and the ripening fruit appears, </p>
<p class="poetry">he will cut off the unproductive shoots with pruning knives;</p>
<p class="poetry">he will prune the tendrils. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">18:6</span> They will all be left for the birds of the hills</p>
<p class="poetry">and the wild animals; </p>
<p class="poetry">the birds will eat them during the summer,</p>
<p class="poetry">and all the wild animals will eat them during the winter. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">18:7</span> At that time</p>
<p class="poetry">tribute will be brought to the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies,</p>
<p class="poetry">by a people that are tall and smooth-skinned,</p>
<p class="poetry">a people that are feared far and wide,</p>
<p class="poetry">a nation strong and victorious,</p>
<p class="poetry">whose land rivers divide. </p>
<p class="poetry">The tribute will be brought to the place where the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has chosen to reside, on Mount Zion. </p>
