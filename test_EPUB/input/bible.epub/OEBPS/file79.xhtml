Just as it was shown you on the mountain, so they must make it. </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">The Courtyard</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">27:9</span> “You are to make the courtyard of the tabernacle.

<p class="paragraphtitle">Offering the Oil</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">27:20</span> “You are to command the Israelites that they bring to you pure oil of pressed olives for the light, so that the lamps will burn regularly. <span class="verse">27:21</span> In the tent of meeting outside the curtain that is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons are to arrange it from evening to morning before the <span class="smcaps">Lord. </span>This is to be a lasting ordinance among the Israelites for generations to come. </p>
