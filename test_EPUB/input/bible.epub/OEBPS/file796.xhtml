<h1>Jeremiah<br />Chapter 27</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Jeremiah Counsels Submission to Babylon </p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">27:1</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> spoke to Jeremiah early in the reign of Josiah’s son, King Zedekiah of Judah. <span class="verse">27:2</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> told me, “Make a yoke out of leather straps and wooden crossbars and put it on your neck. <span class="verse">27:3</span> Use it to send messages to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon. Send them through the envoys who have come to Jerusalem to King Zedekiah of Judah. <span class="verse">27:4</span> Charge them to give their masters a message from me. Tell them, ‘The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says to give your masters this message: <span class="verse">27:5</span> “I made the earth and the people and animals on it by my mighty power and great strength, and I give it to whomever I see fit. <span class="verse">27:6</span> I have at this time placed all these nations of yours under the power of my servant, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. I have even made all the wild animals subject to him. <span class="verse">27:7</span> All nations must serve him and his son and grandson until the time comes for his own nation to fall. Then many nations and great kings will in turn subjugate Babylon. <span class="verse">27:8</span> But suppose a nation or a kingdom will not be subject to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. Suppose it will not submit to the yoke of servitude to him. I, the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, affirm that I will punish that nation. I will use the king of Babylon to punish it with war, starvation, and disease until I have destroyed it. <span class="verse">27:9</span> So do not listen to your prophets or to those who claim to predict the future by divination, by dreams, by consulting the dead, or by practicing magic. They keep telling you, ‘You do not need to be subject to the king of Babylon.’ <span class="verse">27:10</span> Do not listen to them, because their prophecies are lies. Listening to them will only cause you to be taken far away from your native land. I will drive you out of your country and you will die in exile. <span class="verse">27:11</span> Things will go better for the nation that submits to the yoke of servitude to the king of Babylon and is subject to him. I will leave that nation in its native land. Its people can continue to farm it and live in it. I, the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, affirm it!”’” </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">27:12</span> I told King Zedekiah of Judah the same thing. I said, “Submit to the yoke of servitude to the king of Babylon. Be subject to him and his people. Then you will continue to live. <span class="verse">27:13</span> There is no reason why you and your people should die in war or from starvation or disease. That’s what the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> says will happen to any nation that will not be subject to the king of Babylon. <span class="verse">27:14</span> Do not listen to the prophets who are telling you that you do not need to serve the king of Babylon. For they are prophesying lies to you. <span class="verse">27:15</span> For I, the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, affirm that I did not send them. They are prophesying lies to you in my name. If you listen to them, I will drive you and the prophets who are prophesying lies out of the land and you will all die in exile.” </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">27:16</span> I also told the priests and all the people, “The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> says, ‘Do not listen to what your prophets are saying. They are prophesying to you that the valuable articles taken from the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s temple will be brought back from Babylon very soon. But they are prophesying a lie to you. <span class="verse">27:17</span> Do not listen to them. Be subject to the king of Babylon. Then you will continue to live. Why should this city be made a pile of rubble?’” <span class="verse">27:18</span> I also told them, “If they are really prophets and the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> is speaking to them, let them pray earnestly to the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies. Let them plead with him not to let the valuable articles that are still left in the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s temple, in the royal palace of Judah, and in Jerusalem be taken away to Babylon. <span class="verse">27:19</span> For the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has already spoken about the two bronze pillars, the large bronze basin called ‘The Sea,’ and the movable bronze stands. He has already spoken about the rest of the valuable articles that are left in this city. <span class="verse">27:20</span> He has already spoken about these things that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon did not take away when he carried Jehoiakim’s son King Jeconiah of Judah and the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem away as captives from Jerusalem to Babylon. <span class="verse">27:21</span> Indeed, the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, has already spoken about the valuable articles that are left in the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s temple, in the royal palace of Judah, and in Jerusalem. <span class="verse">27:22</span> He has said, ‘They will be carried off to Babylon. They will remain there until it is time for me to show consideration for them again. Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place.’ I, the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, affirm this!” </p>
