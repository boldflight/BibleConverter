<p class="lamhebrew"><span class="hebrew">א</span> (<i>Alef</i>) </p><p class="paragraphtitle">The Prophet Speaks</p><p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:1</span> I am the man who has experienced affliction</p>
<p class="poetry">from the rod of the<span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s wrath.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:2</span> He drove me into captivity and made me walk </p>
<p class="poetry">in darkness and not light. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:3</span> He repeatedly attacks me;</p>
<p class="poetry">he turns his hand against me all day long. </p>
<p class="lamhebrew"><span class="hebrew">ב</span> (<i>Bet</i>)</p><p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:4</span> He has made my mortal skin waste away;</p>
<p class="poetry">he has broken my bones. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:5</span> He has besieged and surrounded me</p>
<p class="poetry">with bitter hardship. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:6</span> He has made me reside in deepest darkness </p>
<p class="poetry">like those who died long ago. </p>
<p class="lamhebrew"><span class="hebrew">ג</span> (<i>Gimel</i>)</p><p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:7</span> He has walled me in so that I cannot get out;</p>
<p class="poetry">he has weighted me down with heavy prison chains. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:8</span> Also, when I cry out desperately for help, </p>
<p class="poetry">he has shut out my prayer. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:9</span> He has blocked every road I take with a wall of hewn stones;</p>
<p class="poetry">he has made every path impassable. </p>
<p class="lamhebrew"><span class="hebrew">ד</span> (<i>Dalet</i>)</p><p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:10</span> To me he is like a bear lying in ambush, </p>
<p class="poetry">like a hidden lion stalking its prey. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:11</span> He has obstructed my paths and torn me to pieces; </p>
<p class="poetry">he has made me desolate. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:12</span> He drew his bow and made me </p>
<p class="poetry">the target for his arrow. </p>
<p class="lamhebrew"><span class="hebrew">ה</span> (<i>He</i>)</p><p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:13</span> He shot his arrows </p>
<p class="poetry">into my heart. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:14</span> I have become the laughingstock of all people, </p>
<p class="poetry">their mocking song all day long. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:15</span> He has given me my fill of bitter herbs</p>
<p class="poetry">and made me drunk with bitterness. </p>
<p class="lamhebrew"><span class="hebrew">ו</span> (<i>Vav</i>)</p><p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:16</span> He ground my teeth in gravel;</p>
<p class="poetry">he trampled me in the dust. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:17</span> I am deprived of peace; </p>
<p class="poetry">I have forgotten what happiness is. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:18</span> So I said, “My endurance has expired;</p>
<p class="poetry">I have lost all hope of deliverance from the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>.”</p>
<p class="lamhebrew"><span class="hebrew">ז</span> (<i>Zayin</i>)</p><p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:19</span> Remember my impoverished and homeless condition, </p>
<p class="poetry">which is a bitter poison. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:20</span> I continually think about this,</p>
<p class="poetry">and I am depressed. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:21</span> But this I call to mind; </p>
<p class="poetry">therefore I have hope: </p>
<p class="lamhebrew"><span class="hebrew">ח</span> (<i>Khet</i>)</p><p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:22</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s loyal kindness never ceases; </p>
<p class="poetry">his compassions never end.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:23</span> They are fresh every morning;</p>
<p class="poetry">your faithfulness is abundant! </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:24</span> “My portion is the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>,” I have said to myself, </p>
<p class="poetry">so I will put my hope in him.</p>
<p class="lamhebrew"><span class="hebrew">ט</span> (<i>Tet</i>)</p><p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:25</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> is good to those who trust in him,</p>
<p class="poetry">to the one who seeks him.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:26</span> It is good to wait patiently </p>
<p class="poetry">for deliverance from the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:27</span> It is good for a man </p>
<p class="poetry">to bear the yoke while he is young. </p>
<p class="lamhebrew"><span class="hebrew">י</span> (<i>Yod</i>)</p><p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:28</span> Let a person sit alone in silence,</p>
<p class="poetry">when the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> is disciplining him. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:29</span> Let him bury his face in the dust; </p>
<p class="poetry">perhaps there is hope. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:30</span> Let him offer his cheek to the one who hits him; </p>
<p class="poetry">let him have his fill of insults. </p>
<p class="lamhebrew"><span class="hebrew">כ</span> (<i>Kaf</i>)</p><p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:31</span> For the Lord will not</p>
<p class="poetry">reject us forever. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:32</span> Though he causes us grief, he then has compassion on us </p>
<p class="poetry">according to the abundance of his loyal kindness. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:33</span> For he is not predisposed to afflict </p>
<p class="poetry">or to grieve people. </p>
<p class="lamhebrew"><span class="hebrew">ל</span> (<i>Lamed</i>)</p><p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:34</span> To crush underfoot</p>
<p class="poetry">all the earth’s prisoners, </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:35</span> to deprive a person of his rights </p>
<p class="poetry">in the presence of the Most High,</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:36</span> to defraud a person in a lawsuit—</p>
<p class="poetry">the Lord does not approve of such things!</p>
<p class="lamhebrew"><span class="hebrew">מ</span> (<i>Mem</i>)</p><p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:37</span> Whose command was ever fulfilled </p>
<p class="poetry">unless the Lord decreed it?</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:38</span> Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that everything comes—</p>
<p class="poetry">both calamity and blessing? </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:39</span> Why should any living person complain</p>
<p class="poetry">when punished for his sins? </p>
<p class="lamhebrew"><span class="hebrew">נ</span> (<i>Nun</i>)</p><p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:40</span> Let us carefully examine our ways, </p>
<p class="poetry">and let us return to the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:41</span> Let us lift up our hearts and our hands</p>
<p class="poetry">to God in heaven: </p>

<p class="poetry">so that no prayer could get through. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3:45</span> You make us like filthy scum </p>
<p class="poetry">in the estimation of the nations. </p>
