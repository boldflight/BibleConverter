<h1>Ezekiel<br />Chapter 10</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">God’s Glory Leaves the Temple</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">10:1</span> As I watched, I saw on the platform above the top of the cherubim something like a sapphire, resembling the shape of a throne, appearing above them. <span class="verse">10:2</span> The<span class="smcaps"> Lord</span> said to the man dressed in linen, “Go between the wheelwork underneath the cherubim. Fill your hands with burning coals from among the cherubim and scatter them over the city.” He went as I watched. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">10:3</span> (The cherubim were standing on the south side of the temple when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner court.) <span class="verse">10:4</span> Then the glory of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> arose from the cherub and moved to the threshold of the temple. The temple was filled with the cloud while the court was filled with the brightness of the <span class="smcaps">Lord’</span>s glory. <span class="verse">10:5</span> The sound of the wings of the cherubim could be heard from the outer court, like the sound of the Sovereign God when he speaks. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">10:6</span> When the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> commanded the man dressed in linen, “Take fire from within the wheelwork, from among the cherubim,” the man went in and stood by one of the wheels. <span class="verse">10:7</span> Then one of the cherubim stretched out his hand toward the fire that was among the cherubim. He took some and put it into the hands of the man dressed in linen, who took it and left. <span class="verse">10:8</span> (The cherubim appeared to have the form of human hands under their wings.) </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">10:9</span> As I watched, I noticed four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel beside each cherub; the wheels gleamed like jasper. <span class="verse">10:10</span> As for their appearance, all four of them looked the same, something like a wheel within a wheel. <span class="verse">10:11</span> When they moved, they would go in any of the four directions they faced without turning as they moved; in the direction the head would turn they would follow without turning as they moved, <span class="verse">10:12</span> along with their entire bodies, their backs, their hands, and their wings. The wheels of the four of them were full of eyes all around. <span class="verse">10:13</span> As for their wheels, they were called “the wheelwork” as I listened. <span class="verse">10:14</span> Each of the cherubim had four faces: The first was the face of a cherub, the second that of a man, the third that of a lion, and the fourth that of an eagle. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">10:15</span> The cherubim rose up; these were the living beings I saw at the Kebar River. <span class="verse">10:16</span> When the cherubim moved, the wheels moved beside them; when the cherubim spread their wings to rise from the ground, the wheels did not move from their side. <span class="verse">10:17</span> When the cherubim stood still, the wheels stood still, and when they rose up, the wheels rose up with them, for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">10:18</span> Then the glory of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> moved away from the threshold of the temple and stopped above the cherubim. <span class="verse">10:19</span> The cherubim spread their wings, and they rose up from the earth while I watched (when they went, the wheels went alongside them). They stopped at the entrance to the east gate of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s temple as the glory of the God of Israel hovered above them.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">10:20</span> These were the living creatures that I saw at the Kebar River underneath the God of Israel; I knew that they were cherubim. <span class="verse">10:21</span> Each had four faces; each had four wings and the form of human hands under the wings. <span class="verse">10:22</span> As for the form of their faces, they were the faces whose appearance I had seen at the Kebar River. Each one moved straight ahead. </p>
