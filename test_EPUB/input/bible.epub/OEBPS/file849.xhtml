<h1>Ezekiel<br />Chapter 21</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">The Sword of Judgment</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">21:1</span> (21:6) The <span class="smcaps">Lord’</span>s message came to me: <span class="verse">21:2</span> “Son of man, turn toward Jerusalem and speak out against the sanctuaries. Prophesy against the land of Israel <span class="verse">21:3</span> and say to them, ‘This is what the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> says: Look, I am against you. I will draw my sword from its sheath and cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked. <span class="verse">21:4</span> Because I will cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked, my sword will go out from its sheath against everyone from the south to the north. <span class="verse">21:5</span> Then everyone will know that I am the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, who drew my sword from its sheath—it will not be sheathed again!’ </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">21:6</span> “And you, son of man, groan with an aching heart and bitterness; groan before their eyes. <span class="verse">21:7</span> When they ask you, ‘Why are you  groaning?’ you will reply, ‘Because of the report that has come. Every heart will melt with fear and every hand will be limp; everyone will faint, and every knee will be wet with urine.’ Pay attention—it is coming and it will happen, declares the Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>.”</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">21:8</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord’</span>s message came to me: <span class="verse">21:9</span> “Son of man, prophesy and say: ‘This is what the Lord says:</p>
<p class="poetry">“‘A sword, a sword is sharpened,</p>
<p class="poetry">and also polished. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">21:10</span> It is sharpened for slaughter, </p>
<p class="poetry">it is polished to flash like lightning!</p>
<p class="bodytext">“‘Should we rejoice in the scepter of my son? No! The sword despises every tree! </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">21:11</span> “‘He gave it to be polished,</p>
<p class="poetry">to be grasped in the hand—</p>
<p class="poetry">the sword is sharpened, it is polished—</p>
<p class="poetry">giving it into the hand of the executioner. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">21:12</span> Cry out and moan, son of man,</p>
<p class="poetry">for it is wielded against my people;</p>
<p class="poetry">against all the princes of Israel.</p>
<p class="poetry">They are delivered up to the sword, along with my people.</p>
<p class="poetry">Therefore, strike your thigh. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">21:13</span> “‘For testing will come, and what will happen when the scepter, which the sword despises, is no more? declares the Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>.’</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">21:14</span> “And you, son of man, prophesy, </p>
<p class="poetry">and clap your hands together.</p>
<p class="poetry">Let the sword strike twice, even three times!</p>
<p class="poetry">It is a sword for slaughter,</p>
<p class="poetry">a sword for the great slaughter surrounding them.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">21:15</span> So hearts melt with fear and many stumble.</p>
<p class="poetry">At all their gates I have stationed the sword for slaughter.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ah! It is made to flash, it is drawn for slaughter! </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">21:16</span> Cut sharply on the right!</p>
<p class="poetry">Swing to the left, </p>
<p class="poetry">wherever your edge is appointed to strike.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">21:17</span> I too will clap my hands together,</p>
<p class="poetry">I will exhaust my rage;</p>
<p class="poetry">I the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> have spoken.” </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">21:18</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord’</span>s message came to me: <span class="verse">21:19</span> “You, son of man, mark out two routes for the king of Babylon’s sword to take; both of them will originate in a single land. Make a signpost and put it at the beginning of the road leading to the city. <span class="verse">21:20</span> Mark out the routes for the sword to take: ‘Rabbah of the Ammonites’ and ‘Judah with Jerusalem in it.’ <span class="verse">21:21</span> For the king of Babylon stands at the fork in the road at the head of the two routes. He looks for omens: He shakes arrows, he consults idols, he examines animal livers. <span class="verse">21:22</span> Into his right hand comes the portent for Jerusalem—to set up battering rams, to give the signal for slaughter, to shout out the battle cry, to set up battering rams against the gates, to erect a siege ramp, to build a siege wall. <span class="verse">21:23</span> But those in Jerusalem will view it as a false omen. They have sworn solemn oaths, but the king of Babylon will accuse them of violations in order to seize them. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">21:24</span> “Therefore this is what the Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> says: ‘Because you have brought up your own guilt by uncovering your transgressions and revealing your sins through all your actions, for this reason you will be taken by force. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">21:25</span> “‘As for you, profane and wicked prince of Israel, </p>
<p class="poetry">whose day has come, the time of final punishment, </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">21:26</span> this is what the Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> says:</p>
<p class="poetry">Tear off the turban; </p>
<p class="poetry">take off the crown!</p>
<p class="poetry">Things must change. </p>
<p class="poetry">Exalt the lowly;</p>
<p class="poetry">bring low the exalted! </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">21:27</span> A total ruin I will make it! </p>
<p class="poetry">Indeed, this will not be</p>
<p class="poetry">until he comes to whom is the right, and I will give it to him.’ </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">21:28</span> “As for you, son of man, prophesy and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> says concerning the Ammonites and their coming humiliation: </p>
<p class="poetry">“‘A sword, a sword drawn for slaughter,</p>
<p class="poetry">polished to consume, to flash like lightning—</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">21:29</span> while seeing false visions about you </p>
<p class="poetry">and reading lying omens about you —</p>
<p class="poetry">to place you on the necks of the profane wicked, </p>
<p class="poetry">whose day has come,</p>
<p class="poetry">the time of final punishment. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">21:30</span> Return it to its sheath! </p>
<p class="poetry">In the place where you were created, </p>
<p class="poetry">in your native land, I will judge you.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">21:31</span> I will pour out my anger on you; </p>
<p class="poetry">the fire of my fury I will blow on you.</p>
<p class="poetry">I will hand you over to brutal men,</p>
<p class="poetry">who are skilled in destruction. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">21:32</span> You will become fuel for the fire—</p>
<p class="poetry">your blood will stain the middle of the land; </p>
<p class="poetry">you will no longer be remembered,</p>
<p class="poetry">for I, the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, have spoken.’” </p>
