<p class="paragraphtitle">Lamentation over Pharaoh and Egypt</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">32:1</span> In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first of the month, the <span class="smcaps">Lord’</span>s message came to me: <span class="verse">32:2</span> “Son of man, sing a lament for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him:</p>
<p class="poetry">“‘You were like a lion among the nations,</p>
<p class="poetry">but you are a monster in the seas;</p>
<p class="poetry">you thrash about in your streams,</p>
<p class="poetry">stir up the water with your feet,</p>
<p class="poetry">and muddy your streams. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">32:3</span> “‘This is what the Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> says:</p>
<p class="poetry">“‘I will throw my net over you in the assembly of many peoples;</p>
<p class="poetry">and they will haul you up in my dragnet. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">32:4</span> I will leave you on the ground,</p>
<p class="poetry">I will fling you on the open field,</p>
<p class="poetry">I will allow all the birds of the sky to settle on you,</p>
<p class="poetry">and I will permit all the wild animals to gorge themselves on you. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">32:5</span> I will put your flesh on the mountains,</p>
<p class="poetry">and fill the valleys with your maggot-infested carcass. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">32:6</span> I will drench the land with the flow </p>
<p class="poetry">of your blood up to the mountains, </p>
<p class="poetry">and the ravines will be full of your blood. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">32:7</span> When I extinguish you, I will cover the sky;</p>
<p class="poetry">I will darken its stars.</p>
<p class="poetry">I will cover the sun with a cloud,</p>
<p class="poetry">and the moon will not shine. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">32:8</span> I will darken all the lights in the sky over you,</p>
<p class="poetry">and I will darken your land,</p>
<p class="poetry">declares the Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">32:9</span> I will disturb many peoples,</p>
<p class="poetry">when I bring about your destruction among the nations,</p>
<p class="poetry">among countries you do not know. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">32:10</span> I will shock many peoples with you,</p>
<p class="poetry">and their kings will shiver with horror because of you.</p>
<p class="poetry">When I brandish my sword before them,</p>
<p class="poetry">every moment each one will tremble for his life, on the day of your fall. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">32:11</span> “‘For this is what the Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> says: </p>

<p class="poetry">all of them are the most terrifying among the nations.</p>
<p class="poetry">They will devastate the pride of Egypt,</p>
<p class="poetry">and all its hordes will be destroyed. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">32:13</span> I will destroy all its cattle beside the plentiful waters;</p>
<p class="poetry">and no human foot will disturb the waters again,</p>
<p class="poetry">nor will the hooves of cattle disturb them.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">32:14</span> Then I will make their waters calm, </p>
<p class="poetry">and will make their streams flow like olive oil, declares the Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">32:15</span> When I turn the land of Egypt into desolation </p>
<p class="poetry">and the land is destitute of everything that fills it,</p>
<p class="poetry">when I strike all those who live in it,</p>
<p class="poetry">then they will know that I am the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>.’</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">32:16</span> This is a lament; they will chant it.</p>

<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">32:17</span> In the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, the <span class="smcaps">Lord’</span>s message came to me: <span class="verse">32:18</span> “Son of man, wail over the horde of Egypt.

Go down and be laid to rest with the uncircumcised!’ <span class="verse">32:20</span> They will fall among those killed by the sword. The sword is drawn; they carry her and all her hordes away. <span class="verse">32:21</span> The bravest of the warriors will speak to him from the midst of Sheol along with his allies, saying: ‘The uncircumcised have come down; they lie still, killed by the sword.’ </p>

Now they will bear their shame with those who descend to the Pit. <span class="verse">32:25</span> Among the dead they have made a bed for her, along with all her hordes around her grave. All of them are uncircumcised, killed by the sword, for their terror had spread in the land of the living.

<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">32:26</span> “Meshech Tubal is there, along with all her hordes around her grave.
