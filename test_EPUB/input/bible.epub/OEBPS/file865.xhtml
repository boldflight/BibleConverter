<h1>Ezekiel<br />Chapter 37</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">The Valley of Dry Bones</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">37:1</span> The hand of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> was on me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> and placed me in the midst of the valley, and it was full of bones. <span class="verse">37:2</span> He made me walk all around among them. I realized there were a great many bones in the valley, and they were very dry. <span class="verse">37:3</span> He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” I said to him, “Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, you know.” <span class="verse">37:4</span> Then he said to me, “Prophesy over these bones, and tell them: ‘Dry bones, listen to the <span class="smcaps">Lord’</span>s message. <span class="verse">37:5</span> This is what the Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> says to these bones: Look, I am about to infuse breath into you and you will live. <span class="verse">37:6</span> I will put tendons on you and muscles over you and will cover you with skin; I will put breath in you, and you will live. Then you will know that I am the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>.’” </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">37:7</span> So I prophesied as I was commanded. There was a sound when I prophesied— I heard a rattling, and the bones came together, bone to bone. <span class="verse">37:8</span> As I watched, I saw tendons on them, then muscles appeared, and skin covered over them from above, but there was no breath in them.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">37:9</span> He said to me, “Prophesy to the breath, —prophesy, son of man—and say to the breath: ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> says: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these corpses so that they may live.’” <span class="verse">37:10</span> So I prophesied as I was commanded, and the breath came into them; they lived and stood on their feet, an  extremely great army. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">37:11</span> Then he said to me, “Son of man, these bones are all the house of Israel. Look, they are saying, ‘Our bones are dry, our hope has perished; we are cut off.’ <span class="verse">37:12</span> Therefore prophesy, and tell them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> says: Look, I am about to open your graves and will raise you from your graves, my people. I will bring you to the land of Israel. <span class="verse">37:13</span> Then you will know that I am the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, when I open your graves and raise you from your graves, my people. <span class="verse">37:14</span> I will place my breath in you and you will live; I will give you rest in your own land. Then you will know that I am the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>—I have spoken and I will act, declares the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>.’” </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">37:15</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord’</span>s message came to me: <span class="verse">37:16</span> “As for you, son of man, take one branch and write on it, ‘For Judah and for the Israelites associated with him.’ Then take another branch and write on it, ‘For Joseph, the branch of Ephraim, and all the house of Israel associated with him.’ <span class="verse">37:17</span> Join them as one stick; they will be as one in your hand. <span class="verse">37:18</span> When your people say to you, ‘Will you not tell us what these things mean?’ <span class="verse">37:19</span> tell them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> says: Look, I am about to take the branch of Joseph that is in the hand of Ephraim and the tribes of Israel associated with him, and I will place them on the stick of Judah and make them into one stick—they will be one in my hand.’ <span class="verse">37:20</span> The sticks you write on will be in your hand in front of them. <span class="verse">37:21</span> Then tell them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> says: Look, I am about to take the Israelites from among the nations where they have gone. I will gather them from round about and bring them to their land. <span class="verse">37:22</span> I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel, and one king will rule over them all. They will never again be two nations and never again be divided into two kingdoms. <span class="verse">37:23</span> They will not defile themselves with their idols, their detestable things, and all their rebellious deeds. I will save them from all their unfaithfulness by which they sinned. I will purify them; they will become my people, and I will become their God. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">37:24</span> “‘My servant David will be king over them; there will be one shepherd for all of them. They will follow my regulations and carefully observe my statutes. <span class="verse">37:25</span> They will live in the land I gave to my servant Jacob, in which your fathers lived; they will live in it—they and their children and their grandchildren forever. David my servant will be prince over them forever. <span class="verse">37:26</span> I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be a perpetual covenant with them. I will establish them, increase their numbers, and place my sanctuary among them forever. <span class="verse">37:27</span> My dwelling place will be with them; I will be their God, and they will be my people. <span class="verse">37:28</span> Then, when my sanctuary is among them forever, the nations will know that I, the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, sanctify Israel.’” </p>
