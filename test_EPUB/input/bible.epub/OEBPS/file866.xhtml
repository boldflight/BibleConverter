<h1>Ezekiel<br />Chapter 38</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">A Prophecy Against Gog</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">38:1</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord’</span>s message came to me: <span class="verse">38:2</span> “Son of man, turn toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal. Prophesy against him <span class="verse">38:3</span> and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> says: Look, I am against you, Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal. <span class="verse">38:4</span> I will turn you around, put hooks into your jaws, and bring you out with all your army, horses, and horsemen, all of them fully armed, a great company with shields of different types, all of them armed with swords. <span class="verse">38:5</span> Persia, Ethiopia, and Put are with them, all of them with shields and helmets. <span class="verse">38:6</span> They are joined by Gomer with all its troops, and by Beth Togarmah from the remote parts of the north with all its troops—many peoples are with you. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">38:7</span> “‘Be ready and stay ready, you and all your companies assembled around you, and be a guard for them. <span class="verse">38:8</span> After many days you will be summoned; in the latter years you will come to a land restored from the ravages of war, from many peoples gathered on the mountains of Israel that had long been in ruins. Its people were brought out from the peoples, and all of them will be living securely. <span class="verse">38:9</span> You will advance; you will come like a storm. You will be like a cloud covering the earth, you, all your troops, and the many other peoples with you. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">38:10</span> “‘This is what the Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> says: On that day thoughts will come into your mind, and you will devise an evil plan. <span class="verse">38:11</span> You will say, “I will invade a land of unwalled towns; I will advance against those living quietly in security—all of them living without walls and barred gates— <span class="verse">38:12</span> to loot and plunder, to attack the inhabited ruins and the people gathered from the nations, who are acquiring cattle and goods, who live at the center of the earth.” <span class="verse">38:13</span> Sheba and Dedan and the traders of Tarshish with all its young warriors will say to you, “Have you come to loot? Have you assembled your armies to plunder, to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to haul away a great amount of spoils?”’ </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">38:14</span> “Therefore, prophesy, son of man, and say to Gog: ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> says: On that day when my people Israel are living securely, you will take notice <span class="verse">38:15</span> and come from your place, from the remote parts of the north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great company and a vast army. <span class="verse">38:16</span> You will advance against my people Israel like a cloud covering the earth. In future days I will bring you against my land so that the nations may acknowledge me, when before their eyes I magnify myself through you, O Gog. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">38:17</span> “‘This is what the Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> says: Are you the one of whom I spoke in former days by my servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days that I would bring you against them? <span class="verse">38:18</span> On that day, when Gog invades the land of Israel, declares the Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, my rage will mount up in my anger. <span class="verse">38:19</span> In my zeal, in the fire of my fury, I declare that on that day there will be a great earthquake in the land of Israel. <span class="verse">38:20</span> The fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the wild beasts, all the things that creep on the ground, and all people who live on the face of the earth will shake at my presence. The mountains will topple, the cliffs will fall, and every wall will fall to the ground. <span class="verse">38:21</span> I will call for a sword to attack Gog on all my mountains, declares the Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>; every man’s sword will be against his brother. <span class="verse">38:22</span> I will judge him with plague and bloodshed. I will rain down on him, his troops, and the many peoples who are with him a torrential downpour, hailstones, fire, and brimstone. <span class="verse">38:23</span> I will exalt and magnify myself; I will reveal myself before many nations. Then they will know that I am the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>.’</p>
