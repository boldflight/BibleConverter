<h1>Ezekiel<br />Chapter 45</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">The Lord’s Portion of the Land</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">45:1</span> “‘When you allot the land as an inheritance, you will offer an allotment to the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, a holy portion from the land; the length will be 8¼ miles and the width 3⅓ miles. This entire area will be holy. <span class="verse">45:2</span> Of this area a square 875 feet by 875 feet will be designated for the sanctuary, with 87½ feet set aside for its open space round about. <span class="verse">45:3</span> From this measured area you will measure a length of 8¼ miles and a width of 3⅓ miles; in it will be the sanctuary, the Most Holy Place. <span class="verse">45:4</span> It will be a holy portion of the land; it will be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary who approach the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> to minister to him. It will be a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary. <span class="verse">45:5</span> An area 8¼ miles in length and 3⅓ miles in width will be for the Levites, who minister at the temple, as the place for the cities in which they will live.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">45:6</span> “‘Alongside the portion set apart as the holy allotment, you will allot for the city an area 1⅔ miles wide and 8¼ miles long; it will be for the whole house of Israel. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">45:7</span> “‘For the prince there will be land on both sides of the holy allotment and the allotted city, on the west side and on the east side; it will be comparable in length to one of the portions, from the west border to the east border <span class="verse">45:8</span> of the land. This will be his property in Israel. My princes will no longer oppress my people, but the land will be allotted to the house of Israel according to their tribes. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">45:9</span> “‘This is what the Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> says: Enough, you princes of Israel! Put away violence and destruction and do what is just and right. Put an end to your evictions of my people, declares the Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse">45:10</span> You must use just balances, a just dry measure (an ephah), and a just liquid measure (a bath). <span class="verse">45:11</span> The dry and liquid measures will be the same: The bath will contain a tenth of a homer, and the ephah a tenth of a homer; the homer will be the standard measure. <span class="verse">45:12</span> The shekel will be twenty gerahs. Sixty shekels will be a mina for you.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">45:13</span> “‘This is the offering you must offer: a sixth of an ephah from a homer of wheat, a sixth of an ephah from a homer of barley, <span class="verse">45:14</span> and as the prescribed portion of olive oil, one-tenth of a bath from each cor (which is ten baths or a homer, for ten baths make a homer); <span class="verse">45:15</span> and one sheep from each flock of 200, from the watered places of Israel, for a grain offering, burnt offering, and peace offering, to make atonement for them, declares the Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse">45:16</span> All the people of the land will contribute to this offering for the prince of Israel. <span class="verse">45:17</span> It will be the duty of the prince to provide the burnt offerings, the grain offering, and the drink offering at festivals, on the new moons and Sabbaths, at all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel; he will provide the sin offering, the grain offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings to make atonement for the house of Israel. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">45:18</span> “‘This is what the Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> says: In the first month, on the first day of the month, you must take an unblemished young bull and purify the sanctuary. <span class="verse">45:19</span> The priest will take some of the blood of the sin offering and place it on the doorpost of the temple, on the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the doorpost of the gate of the inner court. <span class="verse">45:20</span> This is what you must do on the seventh day of the month for anyone who sins inadvertently or through ignorance; so you will make atonement for the temple. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">45:21</span> “‘In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you will celebrate the Passover, and for the seven days of the festival bread made without yeast will be eaten. <span class="verse">45:22</span> On that day the prince will provide for himself and for all the people of the land a bull for a sin offering. <span class="verse">45:23</span> And during the seven days of the feast he will provide as a burnt offering to the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> seven bulls and seven rams, all without blemish, on each of the seven days, and a male goat daily for a sin offering. <span class="verse">45:24</span> He will provide as a grain offering an ephah for each bull, an ephah for each ram, and a gallon of olive oil for each ephah of grain. <span class="verse">45:25</span> In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, at the feast, he will make the same provisions for the sin offering, burnt offering, and grain offering, and for the olive oil, for the seven days. </p>
