<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">37:6</span> He made an atonement lid of pure gold; its length was 45 inches, and its width was 27 inches. <span class="verse">37:7</span> He made two cherubim of gold; he made them of hammered metal on the two ends of the atonement lid, <span class="verse">37:8</span> one cherub on one end and one cherub on the other end. He made the cherubim from the atonement lid on its two ends. <span class="verse">37:9</span> The cherubim were spreading their wings upward, overshadowing the atonement lid with their wings.

<p class="paragraphtitle">The Making of the Lampstand</p><p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">37:17</span> Bezalel made the lampstand of pure gold.
