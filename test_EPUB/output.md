JUDE

**JUDE 1 Jude . . . brother of James.** See Introduction: Author. If, as is likely, the James and Jude who authored NT epistles were Jesus’ half-brothers (Matt. 13:55), it is noteworthy that neither introduces himself in terms of this familial connection to Jesus. Both identify themselves as “servants” (slaves) of Jesus, perhaps implying that their leadership positions in the church are not attributable to their biological proximity to the Messiah but rather to His calling and gifting by grace.

**called.** The expression of God’s sovereign and gracious initiative in effectually summoning to salvation those whom He has chosen (cf. Rom. 8:28–30).

**beloved.** That is, God has “set apart” for His special care and use those whom He has called.

**kept for Jesus Christ.** See text note. The elect will persevere in faith because God preserves them (v. 24; John 10:27–30; 1 Pet. 1:5).

**JUDE 2 mercy, peace, and love.** Jude fills a traditional Jewish greeting (“mercy and peace”) with profound Christian meaning by adding “love.” God’s mercy to undeserving sinners and the peace that results are grounded in His love manifested in Jesus Christ (John 3:16).

**JUDE 3 I found it necessary.** Instead of the doctrinal treatise he had intended to write on “our common salvation,” which presumably would have been more positive and less polemical, Jude feels compelled to address the problem of false teachers (v. 4). We do not know whether his original intention was fulfilled at some other time.

**contend for the faith.** Here “faith” indicates the doctrinal content of the message taught by the apostles and held in common by all Christians (note the preceding “our common salvation”), rather than the personal exercise of trust by a believer. Christianity includes an authoritative body of belief given by God to the church through the apostles (1 Cor. 15:3–8). Together with the OT (Eph. 2:20), this apostolic witness, as found in the NT, is the standard for the church (2 John 9, 10).

**JUDE 4 certain people . . . crept in unnoticed.** The troublemakers apparently were not part of the specific church Jude addresses; perhaps they presented themselves as itinerant prophets or teachers (2 John 10, 11).

**designated for this condemnation.** This difficult phrase probably refers to various prophecies about the coming and condemnation of ungodly men like the false teachers, perhaps including the prophecy of Enoch in vv. 14, 15 and the apostolic prophecies in vv. 17, 18. Or less likely, it may refer to the recording of the fate of the wicked in heavenly books (Jer. 22:30; Rev. 17:8). The idea is quite similar to that in 1 Pet. 2:8b: “They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do.”

**pervert the grace of our God into sensuality.** Jude’s opponents were guilty of antinomianism—the belief that Christians are under no obligation to follow the moral law as a rule of life. Such teaching was a persistent problem in the early church (Rom. 3:8; 6:15; 1 Cor. 6:12–15; Gal. 5:13), especially where Paul’s emphasis upon justification by grace through faith was misunderstood and perverted.

**deny . . . Master . . . Lord, Jesus Christ.** By their godless and immoral behavior, the false teachers deny Christ. The designation of Christ as “Lord” recognizes Christ’s deity.

**JUDE 5–7** Three examples from ancient history show that those who abuse privileges bestowed by God will in the end receive punishment and destruction from His hand. The Israelites who enjoyed rescue from Egyptian slavery at the exodus afterward died in the wilderness because they did not believe that God could enable them to conquer the pagan nations that populated the Promised Land (Num. 14:27–34). Angels who held privileged positions of authority rebelled against their Creator and are now imprisoned in darkness, awaiting destruction at the last judgment. Jude does not mention the lushness of Sodom, Gomorrah, and their environs (according to Gen. 13:10, “well watered everywhere like the garden of the Lord”), but he may assume that his readers recall what attracted Lot to those cities. Those cities’ sexual perversions brought about their fiery destruction (Gen. 18:16–19:29).

**5 Jesus, who saved a people.** Various manuscripts have “the Lord, who saved,” but the ESV reflects the most likely reading (see Introduction: Christ in Jude). Strikingly, Jude uses the human name conferred on the incarnate Son at his birth to refer to His preincarnate deliverance of Israel in the exodus. Jude thus makes explicit what other NT authors also teach, that the eternal Son of God who became man in the fullness of time personally preexisted His incarnation and was active as the One through whom God created the universe (John 1:3; Col. 1:16; Heb. 1:2) and through whom He has redeemed His people (Ex. 3:14; John 8:58).

**destroyed those who did not believe.** God judged Israel with forty years of wandering in the wilderness for unbelief when they refused to enter Canaan after the report of the spies (Num. 14:27–34; Heb. 3:16–19). Just as judgment fell on the apostate Israelites after their deliverance from Egypt, so will it fall on apostate church members (Heb. 4:1, 2).

**JUDE 6 angels.** See note on 2 Pet. 2:4.

**not stay within their own position . . . left their proper dwelling.** The angels in question rebelled against their God-given responsibilities and abandoned their areas of ministry or residence. Some take this to mean that they left heaven and came to the earth. It may refer to a primordial fall of angels at the time Satan rebelled against the Lord.

**the great day.** The day of judgment at the second coming of Christ.

**JUDE 7 likewise.** In the perversity of their sexual transgression, Sodom, Gomorrah, and the other cities resemble the wicked angels (or the wicked generation of Noah’s day) of v. 6. Just as the fallen angels rejected the worship of God and exchanged it for the worship of self, so Sodom, Gomorrah, and the surrounding cities exchanged the glory of the Creator for the creation and were therefore handed over to their sin (cf. Rom. 1:21–27) The comparison could also point to the flagrancy and pride with which they deserted their proper place. Since the preceding analogies portray the sequence—privilege, rebellion, destruction—in the experience of Israel after the exodus and the fallen angels, perhaps Jude expects his readers to recall the Edenic fertility of the Jordan Valley in which Sodom, Gomorrah, and the surrounding cities were located (Gen. 13:10), making their defiance of the Lord all the more inexcusable.

**sexual immorality and . . . unnatural desire.** The “unnatural desire” in view is the homosexuality described in Gen. 19:4, 5.

**an example . . . punishment of eternal fire.** The fiery destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns in Gen. 19 serves throughout Scripture as a model of God’s judgment on sin (Deut. 29:23; Is. 1:9; Jer. 49:17, 18; Rom. 9:29).

**JUDE 8 dreams.** Probably a reference to the false teachers’ claims to divine revelation through visionary experiences (see. Col. 2:18), claims they might use to justify the three actions that follow.

**defile the flesh.** Sexual immorality (v. 4 and note), perhaps even homosexuality (v. 7; Rom. 1:26, 27).

**reject authority.** Though some take this to be human or angelic authority, a reference to the lordship and authority of Jesus Christ is more likely (v. 4).

**blaspheme the glorious ones.** See note on 2 Pet. 2:10.

**JUDE 9 the archangel Michael.** According to Dan. 10:13, 21; 12:1, Michael is one of the chief angels and the special guardian of Israel. In Rev. 12:7, Michael leads the angelic host in war against the devil and his angels.

**Evidence indicates that this incident finds parallel in the Assumption of Moses, an apocryphal Jewish work (of which only fragments have survived), which expands on the narrative of the burial of Moses in Deut. 34:5, 6 (see Introduction: Special Issues). The story concerns a confrontation between the archangel Michael and the devil over possession of the body of Moses. As usually interpreted, Jude’s point is that the rash talk of the false teachers contrasts with the temperate speech of Michael (2 Pet. 2:10 and note). Others interpret Jude as contrasting Michael’s appeal to God’s authority with the false teachers’ claim to having their own spiritual authority. Some contend that this was a fictional narrative in the Assumption of Moses. However, since all the other OT examples adduced in vv. 6–8, 11 refer to actual events from OT history, this small episode narrated in the Assumption of Moses most probably is a historical event, though not recorded in Deuteronomy. It was likely a historical event that was preserved in Jewish memory, which was then picked up and written down in the Assumption of Moses, from which Jude may have drawn. Contrariwise, Jude may just have known it as a part of Jewish tradition that he heard from a young age.**

**JUDE 11 way of Cain.** See Gen. 4:1–15; Heb. 11:4; 1 John 3:12. According to Jewish tradition, to which Jude may be referring, Cain was the archetypal sinner and the instructor of others in sin.

**Balaam’s error.** Balaam’s readiness to abuse his prophetic gift “for the sake of gain” is recorded in Num. 22–24; 31:16. See note on 2 Pet. 2:15.

**Korah’s rebellion.** Korah, along with Dathan and Abiram, led 250 men in rebellion against the authority of Moses and Aaron (Num. 16). Korah’s rebellion and the resulting divine judgment provide an apt parallel to the defiance of the false teachers against church authority and the false teachers’ dangerous ability to lead others astray, as well as a graphic illustration of the divine judgment awaiting the false teachers (Num. 16:31–33).

**JUDE 12 hidden reefs.** The Gk. word translated “blemishes” usually means “rocks” or “hidden reefs,” which are a danger to ships. If Jude is making a play on words, it is to the effect that teachers are “dangerous, rocky blemishes” in what should be and may appear temporarily to be calm waters in the midst of the church.

**love feasts.** See note on 2 Pet. 2:13; cf. 1 Cor. 11:20–34. This may be a reference to the Lord’s Supper or to meals associated with the observance of the sacrament.

**feast with you without fear.** The false teachers may have made the love feasts occasions for blatant immorality. Even apart from this, their presence at the meals would have been a concern to Jude. Because teaching took place at the love feasts (Acts 20:7, 11), there was opportunity for the false teachers to advance their ideas.

**waterless clouds.** A metaphor for a form of hypocrisy that fails to produce what is promised (cf. 2 Pet. 2:17 note).

**fruitless trees . . . twice dead, uprooted.** Like trees that fail to bear fruit at harvest time, the lives of these people are barren and fall under God’s judgment (Matt. 7:16–20; Luke 13:6–9).

**JUDE 13 wandering stars.** Shooting stars, comets, or most probably, planets. Either the opponents’ teaching is short-lived (like the light of a shooting star) or untrustworthy and useless (as when an unpredictable heavenly body is used for navigation).

**JUDE 14 Enoch, the seventh from Adam.** The Enoch of Gen. 5:24 is seventh from Adam if Adam is counted as the first. In vv. 14, 15, Jude seems to quote almost verbatim from an apocryphal work called the Book of Enoch or 1 Enoch, which dates from the intertestamental period in its extant form. In doing so, Jude does not imply that 1 Enoch is divinely inspired or that this book was written by Enoch himself (Gen. 5:24). The source he uses was familiar to his readers and would be useful for confirming his theme of coming divine judgment on the ungodly (see Introduction: Special Issues).

**prophesied.** Based on Jude’s use of this quotation from 1 Enoch, this statement is a historical saying that was preserved in Jewish tradition and later recorded in 1 Enoch. Alternatively, both 1 Enoch and Jude may refer to an early common oral tradition that recorded an actual historical statement from Enoch.

**The quotation from 1 Enoch, in agreement with a host of OT prophecies (e.g., Dan. 7:9, 10; Zech. 14:3–5), teaches that God will come with His heavenly hosts to judge the wicked, and Jude is justified in applying this biblical idea to his specific situation.**

**holy ones.** Probably a reference to the angelic host that will accompany the Lord’s return (Zech. 14:5; Matt. 25:31).

**JUDE 15 ungodly . . . ungodliness . . . ungodly . . . ungodly.** The repetition of this term is important and serves to emphasize the wickedness of those who will be judged by the Lord; the same Gk. word is used in vv. 4 and 18. Rebellion by the false teachers is first and foremost against God and His authority, and they will be deservedly and certainly judged by God if they do not repent (v. 4 note).

**JUDE 16 grumblers, malcontents.** Like Israel in the wilderness (v. 5; 1 Cor. 10:10), the false teachers resist God’s will, perhaps by complaining about the law’s restrictions on their behavior.

**loud-mouthed boasters.** These may have been claims to having visionary experiences (v. 8), freedom from the law (vv. 4, 8), or possession of the Holy Spirit (vv. 18, 19).

**showing favoritism to gain advantage.** They show partiality to the rich members of the church (cf. James 2:1–4), and perhaps go on to adapt their teaching to please the influential in their audience.

**JUDE 18 last time.** The incarnation of Christ inaugurated the “last days” (Acts 2:17; Heb. 1:2) or “last times.” See note on 1 Pet. 1:20.

**scoffers.** They mock especially the moral law of God and the certainty of divine punishment on the disobedient (Pss. 1:1; 35:16; Prov. 14:9; 2 Pet. 3:3, 4). Paul told Timothy to anticipate people’s increasing self-centeredness and self-indulgence, hypocrisy, and false teaching as “the last days” progressed (2 Tim. 3:1–9).

**JUDE 19 cause divisions.** Division in the church was an inevitable result of the false teachers’ arrogance (v. 16) and their claim, against the church leadership and ordinary Christians, to possess the Spirit. The false teachers may have been classifying people as the later Gnostics did into the “spiritual” (themselves) and the “natural” (ordinary Christians).

**worldly people, devoid of the Spirit.** Against his opponents’ claims, Jude argues that the false teachers themselves are the ones whose lives show that they are in the bondage and service of sin (v. 10). They are not true believers, though they may profess to be.

**JUDE 20–23** Jude now turns from denunciation of the false teachers to positive exhortation of his readers. To contend for the faith when it is under attack means more than opposing false teachers with words. It involves a positive life faithful to the gospel. The Trinitarian form of Jude’s exhortation should be noted (“Holy Spirit . . . God . . . Lord Jesus Christ”).

**20 building . . . holy faith.** Jude, like Peter (1 Pet. 2:5) and Paul (1 Cor. 3:16, 17), compares the church to a building. As in v. 3, “faith” refers to the foundational message of the prophets and apostles (Eph. 2:20–22).

**praying in the Holy Spirit.** In contrast to the false teachers, the prayers of Jude’s readers are controlled by the Spirit, as indeed their whole lives should be (Gal. 5:16–18; Eph. 6:18).

**JUDE 21 keep yourselves in the love of God**. Jude writes to those whom God has called, loved, and “kept” for Jesus Christ (v. 1), and he assures believers that God is “able to keep” (or “guard,” a different Gk. word) them from stumbling and to present them to Himself blameless on the last day (v. 24 note). Yet God’s preservation of the saints does not minimize believers’ responsibility to persevere in faith and to support each other’s perseverance. One of the key means by which Christ saves believers “to the uttermost” (Heb. 7:25) is our unceasing exhortation and encouragement of each other in faith (Heb. 3:12; 12:12–17). Christians must keep each other in the love of God through mercifully encouraging the doubting (v. 22) and snatching the disobedient from sin’s destructive fires (v. 23). By keeping themselves in God’s love, genuine followers of Christ stand in contrast to angels who did not “keep” their original position of authority in submission to God and are therefore “kept” in chains awaiting judgment (v. 6), and in contrast to the corrupt infiltrators of the church, for whom the darkest gloom has been “kept” forever (v. 13).

**JUDE 22, 23** The exact Gk. text of these verses is disputed, and it is hard to tell whether two or three groups of sinners are in view. Whatever the textual solution, Jude clearly recognizes that different pastoral strategies are to be employed with different people. Some can profit from gentle counseling (Gal. 6:1). Others will require confrontation or action of some sort to pull them “out of the fire.”

**23 mercy with fear.** Aware of their own vulnerability to temptation, believers must reach out to those caught in patterns of sin with both compassion and humility, “lest you too be tempted” (cf. 1 Cor. 5:6–11; 15:32–34; Gal. 6:1).

**garment stained by the flesh.** A vivid metaphor for the contaminating influence of the false teachers, this phrase underscores the care that Jude’s readers must exercise in their contact with the false teachers and those under their influence (1 Cor. 5:11; 2 John 10, 11). On the metaphor, see Is. 64:6; Zech. 3:1–5; Matt. 22:12; Rev. 3:4, 5, 18; 19:8.

**JUDE 24, 25** Like Rom. 16:25–27, Jude’s conclusion is a doxology that expresses confidence in God’s power to preserve His people to the end, and acknowledges God’s eternal greatness in His “glory, majesty, dominion, and authority.”

**24 him who is able to keep you.** Here “keep” could be translated “guard” (v. 21 note), with the connotation of military protection. No one can snatch Jesus’ sheep out of his hand (John 10:28, 29; cf. 17:12). As believers’ inheritance is “kept” for them in heaven, so they are “guarded” (another Gk. verb) on earth through faith until the final revelation of their full salvation (1 Pet. 1:4, 5). All whom God justifies He also glorifies (Rom. 8:28–30).
