# Joel

## Chapter 1

### Introduction

[1] This is the **Lord**’s message that came to Joel the son of Pethuel:

### A Locust Plague Foreshadows the Day of the Lord

[2] Listen to this, you elders;<br>
pay attention, all inhabitants of the land.<br>
Has anything like this ever happened in your whole life<br>
or in the lifetime of your ancestors?<br>
[3] Tell your children about it,<br>
have your children tell their children,<br>
and their children the following generation.<br>
[4] What the _gazam_-locust left the _‘arbeh_-locust consumed,<br>
what the _‘arbeh_-locust left the _yeleq_-locust consumed,<br>
and what the _yeleq_-locust left the _hasil_-locust consumed.<br>

[5] Wake up, you drunkards, and weep!<br>
Wail, all you wine drinkers,<br>
because the sweet wine has been taken away from you.<br>
[6] For a nation has invaded my land,<br>
mighty and without number.<br>
Their teeth are lion’s teeth;<br>
they have the fangs of a lioness.<br>
[7] They have destroyed my vines;<br>
they have turned my fig trees into mere splinters.<br>
They have completely stripped off the bark and thrown it aside;<br>
the twigs are stripped bare.<br>
### A Call to Lament

[8] Wail like a young virgin clothed in sackcloth,<br>
lamenting the death of her husband to be.<br>
[9] No one brings grain offerings or drink offerings<br>
to the temple of the **Lord** anymore.<br>
So the priests, those who serve the **Lord**, are in mourning.<br>
[10] The crops of the fields have been destroyed.<br>
The ground is in mourning because the grain has perished.<br>
The fresh wine has dried up;<br>
the olive oil languishes.<br>
[11] Be distressed, farmers;<br>
wail, vinedressers, over the wheat and the barley.<br>
For the harvest of the field has perished.<br>
[12] The vine has dried up;<br>
the fig tree languishes—<br>
the pomegranate, date, and apple as well.<br>
In fact, all the trees of the field have dried up.<br>
Indeed, the joy of the people has dried up!<br>

[13] Get dressed and lament, you priests.<br>
Wail, you who minister at the altar.<br>
Come, spend the night in sackcloth, you servants of my God,<br>
because no one brings grain offerings or drink offerings<br>
to the temple of your God anymore.<br>
[14] Announce a holy fast;<br>
proclaim a sacred assembly.<br>
Gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land<br>
to the temple of the **Lord** your God,<br>
and cry out to the **Lord**.<br>
[15] How awful that day will be!<br>
For the day of the **Lord** is near;<br>
it will come as destruction from the Divine Destroyer.<br>
[16] Our food has been cut off right before our eyes!<br>
There is no longer any joy or gladness in the temple of our God.<br>
[17] The grains of seed have shriveled beneath their shovels.<br>
Storehouses have been decimated,<br>
and granaries have been torn down,<br>
because the grain has dried up.<br>
[18] Listen to the cattle groan!<br>
The herds of livestock wander around in confusion<br>
because they have no pasture.<br>
Even the flocks of sheep are suffering.<br>

[19] To you, O **Lord**, I call out for help,<br>
for fire has burned up the pastures of the wilderness,<br>
flames have razed all the trees in the fields.<br>
[20] Even the wild animals cry out to you,<br>
for the river beds have dried up;<br>
fire has destroyed the pastures of the wilderness.<br>
## Chapter 2

### The Locusts’ Devastation

[1] Blow the trumpet in Zion;<br>
sound the alarm signal on my holy mountain!<br>
Let all the inhabitants of the land shake with fear,<br>
for the day of the **Lord** is about to come.<br>
Indeed, it is near!<br>
[2] It will be a day of dreadful darkness,<br>
a day of foreboding storm clouds,<br>
like blackness spread over the mountains.<br>
It is a huge and powerful army —<br>
there has never been anything like it ever before,<br>
and there will not be anything like it for many generations to come!<br>

[3] Like fire they devour everything in their path;<br>
a flame blazes behind them.<br>
The land looks like the Garden of Eden before them,<br>
but behind them there is only a desolate wilderness—<br>
for nothing escapes them!<br>
[4] They look like horses;<br>
they charge ahead like war horses.<br>
[5] They sound like chariots rumbling over mountain tops,<br>
like the crackling of blazing fire consuming stubble,<br>
like the noise of a mighty army being drawn up for battle.<br>
[6] People writhe in fear when they see them.<br>
All their faces turn pale with fright.<br>
[7] They charge like warriors;<br>
they scale walls like soldiers.<br>
Each one proceeds on his course;<br>
they do not alter their path.<br>
[8] They do not jostle one another;<br>
each of them marches straight ahead.<br>
They burst through the city defenses<br>
and do not break ranks.<br>
[9] They rush into the city;<br>
they scale its walls.<br>
They climb up into the houses;<br>
they go in through the windows like a thief.<br>
[10] The earth quakes before them;<br>
the sky reverberates.<br>
The sun and the moon grow dark;<br>
the stars refuse to shine.<br>
[11] The voice of the **Lord** thunders as he leads his army.<br>
Indeed, his warriors are innumerable;<br>
Surely his command is carried out!<br>
Yes, the day of the **Lord** is awesome<br>
and very terrifying—who can survive it?<br>
### An Appeal for Repentance

[12] “Yet even now,” the **Lord** says,<br>
“return to me with all your heart—<br>
with fasting, weeping, and mourning.<br>
[13] Tear your hearts,<br>
not just your garments.”<br>
Return to the **Lord** your God,<br>
for he is merciful and compassionate,<br>
slow to anger and boundless in loyal love —often relenting from calamitous punishment.<br>
[14] Who knows?<br>
Perhaps he will be compassionate and grant a reprieve,<br>
and leave blessing in his wake —<br>
a meal offering and a drink offering for you to offer to the **Lord** your God!<br>

[15] Blow the trumpet in Zion.<br>
Announce a holy fast;<br>
proclaim a sacred assembly.<br>
[16] Gather the people;<br>
sanctify an assembly!<br>
Gather the elders;<br>
gather the children and the nursing infants.<br>
Let the bridegroom come out from his bedroom<br>
and the bride from her private quarters.<br>
[17] Let the priests, those who serve the **Lord**, weep<br>
from the vestibule all the way back to the altar.<br>
Let them say, “Have pity, O **Lord**, on your people;<br>
please do not turn over your inheritance to be mocked,<br>
to become a proverb among the nations.<br>
Why should it be said among the peoples,<br>
‘Where is their God?’<br>
### The Lord’s Response

[18] Then the **Lord** became zealous for his land;<br>
he had compassion on his people.<br>
[19] The **Lord** responded to his people,<br>
“Look! I am about to restore your grain<br>
as well as fresh wine and olive oil.<br>
You will be fully satisfied.<br>
I will never again make you an object of mockery among the nations.<br>
[20] I will remove the one from the north far from you.<br>
I will drive him out to a dry and desolate place.<br>
Those in front will be driven eastward into the Dead Sea,<br>
and those in back westward into the Mediterranean Sea.<br>
His stench will rise up as a foul smell.”<br>
Indeed, the **Lord** has accomplished great things!<br>

[21] Do not fear, my land.<br>
Rejoice and be glad,<br>
because the **Lord** has accomplished great things!<br>
[22] Do not fear, wild animals.<br>
For the pastures of the wilderness are again green with grass.<br>
Indeed, the trees bear their fruit;<br>
the fig tree and the vine yield to their fullest.<br>
[23] Citizens of Zion, rejoice!<br>
Be glad because of what the **Lord** your God has done!<br>
For he has given to you the early rains as vindication.<br>
He has sent to you the rains—<br>
both the early and the late rains as formerly.<br>
[24] The threshing floors are full of grain;<br>
the vats overflow with fresh wine and olive oil.<br>
[25] I will make up for the years<br>
that the _‘arbeh_-locust consumed your crops —<br>
the _yeleq_-locust, the _hasil_-locust, and the _gazam_-locust —<br>
my great army that I sent against you.<br>
[26] You will have plenty to eat,<br>
and your hunger will be fully satisfied;<br>
you will praise the name of the **Lord** your God,<br>
who has acted wondrously in your behalf.<br>
My people will never again be put to shame.<br>
[27] You will be convinced that I am in the midst of Israel.<br>
I am the **Lord** your God; there is no other.<br>
My people will never again be put to shame.<br>
### An Outpouring of the Spirit

[28] (3:1) After all of this<br>
I will pour out my Spirit on all kinds of people.<br>
Your sons and daughters will prophesy.<br>
Your elderly will have prophetic dreams;<br>
your young men will see visions.<br>
[29] Even on male and female servants<br>
I will pour out my Spirit in those days.<br>
[30] I will produce portents both in the sky and on the earth—<br>
blood, fire, and columns of smoke.<br>
[31] The sunlight will be turned to darkness<br>
and the moon to the color of blood,<br>
before the day of the **Lord** comes—<br>
that great and terrible day!<br>
[32] It will so happen that<br>
everyone who calls on the name of the **Lord** will be delivered.<br>
For on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who survive,<br>
just as the **Lord** has promised;<br>
the remnant will be those whom the **Lord** will call.<br>
## Chapter 3

### The Lord Plans to Judge the Nations

[1] (4:1) For look! In those days and at that time<br>
I will return the exiles to Judah and Jerusalem.<br>
[2] Then I will gather all the nations,<br>
and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat.<br>
I will enter into judgment against them there<br>
concerning my people Israel who are my inheritance,<br>
whom they scattered among the nations.<br>
They partitioned my land,<br>
[3] and they cast lots for my people.<br>
They traded a boy for a prostitute;<br>
they sold a little girl for wine so they could drink.<br>
[4] Why are you doing these things to me, Tyre and Sidon?<br>
Are you trying to get even with me, land of Philistia?<br>
If you are, I will very quickly repay you for what you have done!<br>
[5] For you took my silver and my gold<br>
and brought my precious valuables to your own palaces.<br>
[6] You sold Judeans and Jerusalemites to the Greeks,<br>
removing them far from their own country.<br>
[7] Look! I am rousing them from that place to which you sold them.<br>
I will repay you for what you have done!<br>
[8] I will sell your sons and daughters to the people of Judah.<br>
They will sell them to the Sabeans, a nation far away.<br>
Indeed, the **Lord** has spoken.<br>
### Judgment in the Valley of Jehoshaphat

[9] Proclaim this among the nations:<br>
“Prepare for a holy war!<br>
Call out the warriors!<br>
Let all these fighting men approach and attack!<br>
[10] Beat your plowshares into swords,<br>
and your pruning hooks into spears.<br>
Let the weak say, ‘I too am a warrior!’<br>
[11] Lend your aid and come,<br>
all you surrounding nations,<br>
and gather yourselves to that place.”<br>
Bring down, O **Lord**, your warriors!<br>
[12] “Let the nations be roused and let them go up<br>
to the Valley of Jehoshaphat,<br>
for there I will sit in judgment on all the surrounding nations.<br>
[13] Rush forth with the sickle, for the harvest is ripe!<br>
Come, stomp the grapes, for the winepress is full!<br>
The vats overflow.<br>
Indeed, their evil is great!”<br>

[14] Crowds, great crowds are in the Valley of Decision,<br>
for the day of the **Lord** is near in the Valley of Decision!<br>
[15] The sun and moon are darkened;<br>
the stars withhold their brightness.<br>
[16] The **Lord** roars from Zion;<br>
from Jerusalem his voice bellows out.<br>
The heavens and the earth shake.<br>
But the **Lord** is a refuge for his people;<br>
he is a stronghold for the citizens of Israel.<br>
### The Lord’s Presence in Zion

[17] “You will be convinced that I the **Lord** am your God,<br>
dwelling on Zion, my holy mountain.<br>
Jerusalem will be holy—<br>
conquering armies will no longer pass through it.<br>
[18] “On that day the mountains will drip with sweet wine,<br>
and the hills will flow with milk.<br>
All the dry stream beds of Judah will flow with water.<br>
A spring will flow out from the temple of the **Lord**,<br>
watering the Valley of Acacia Trees.<br>
[19] Egypt will be desolate<br>
and Edom will be a desolate wilderness,<br>
because of the violence they did to the people of Judah,<br>
in whose land they shed innocent blood.<br>
[20] But Judah will reside securely forever,<br>
and Jerusalem will be secure from one generation to the next.<br>
[21] I will avenge their blood that I had not previously acquitted.<br>
It is the **Lord** who dwells in Zion!<br>
