# Ecclesiastes

## Chapter 1

### Title

[1] The words of the Teacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem:

### Introduction: Utter Futility

[2] “Futile! Futile!” laments the Teacher.<br>
“Absolutely futile! Everything is futile!”<br>

### Futility Illustrated from Nature

[3] What benefit do people get from all the effort<br>
which they expend on earth?<br>
[4] A generation comes and a generation goes,<br>
but the earth remains the same through the ages.<br>
[5] The sun rises and the sun sets;<br>
it hurries away to a place from which it rises again.<br>
[6] The wind goes to the south and circles around to the north;<br>
round and round the wind goes and on its rounds it returns.<br>
[7] All the streams flow into the sea, but the sea is not full,<br>
and to the place where the streams flow, there they will flow again.<br>
[8] All this monotony is tiresome; no one can bear to describe it.<br>
The eye is never satisfied with seeing, nor is the ear ever content with hearing.<br>
[9] What exists now is what will be,<br>
and what has been done is what will be done;<br>
there is nothing truly new on earth.<br>
[10] Is there anything about which someone can say, “Look at this! It is new”?<br>
It was already done long ago, before our time.<br>
[11] No one remembers the former events,<br>
nor will anyone remember the events that are yet to happen;<br>
they will not be remembered by the future generations.<br>

### Futility of Secular Accomplishment

[12] I, the Teacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.<br>
[13] I decided to carefully and thoroughly examine<br>
all that has been accomplished on earth.<br>
I concluded: God has given people a burdensome task<br>
that keeps them occupied.<br>
[14] I reflected on everything that is accomplished by man on earth,<br>
and I concluded: Everything he has accomplished is futile —like chasing the wind!<br>
[15] What is bent cannot be straightened,<br>
and what is missing cannot be supplied.<br>

### Futility of Secular Wisdom

[16] I thought to myself,<br>
“I have become much wiser than any of my predecessors who ruled over Jerusalem;<br>
I have acquired much wisdom and knowledge.”<br>
[17] So I decided to discern the benefit of wisdom and knowledge over foolish behavior and ideas;<br>
however, I concluded that even this endeavor is like trying to chase the wind.<br>
[18] For with great wisdom comes great frustration;<br>
whoever increases his knowledge merely increases his heartache.<br>
## Chapter 2

### Futility of Self-Indulgent Pleasure

[1] I thought to myself,

“Come now, I will try self-indulgent pleasure to see if it is worthwhile.”<br>
But I found that it also is futile.<br>
[2] I said of partying, “It is folly,”<br>
and of self-indulgent pleasure, “It accomplishes nothing!”<br>
[3] I thought deeply about the effects of indulging myself with wine<br>
(all the while my mind was guiding me with wisdom)<br>
and the effects of behaving foolishly,<br>
so that I might discover what is profitable<br>
for people to do on earth during the few days of their lives.<br>

### Futility of Materialism

[4] I increased my possessions:<br>
I built houses for myself;<br>
I planted vineyards for myself.<br>
[5] I designed royal gardens and parks for myself,<br>
and I planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.<br>
[6] I constructed pools of water for myself,<br>
to irrigate my grove of flourishing trees.<br>
[7] I purchased male and female slaves,<br>
and I owned slaves who were born in my house;<br>
I also possessed more livestock—both herds and flocks—<br>
than any of my predecessors in Jerusalem.<br>
[8] I also amassed silver and gold for myself,<br>
as well as valuable treasures taken from kingdoms and provinces.<br>
I acquired male singers and female singers for myself,<br>
and what gives a man sensual delight —a harem of beautiful concubines.<br>
[9] So I was far wealthier than all my predecessors in Jerusalem,<br>
yet I maintained my objectivity.<br>
[10] I did not restrain myself from getting whatever I wanted;<br>
I did not deny myself anything that would bring me pleasure.<br>
So all my accomplishments gave me joy;<br>
this was my reward for all my effort.<br>
[11] Yet when I reflected on everything I had accomplished<br>
and on all the effort that I had expended to accomplish it,<br>
I concluded: “All these achievements and possessions are ultimately profitless —<br>
like chasing the wind!<br>
There is nothing gained from them on earth.”<br>

### Wisdom is Better than Folly

[12] Next, I decided to consider wisdom, as well as foolish behavior and ideas.<br>
For what more can the king’s successor do than what the king has already done?<br>
[13] I realized that wisdom is preferable to folly,<br>
just as light is preferable to darkness:<br>
[14] The wise man can see where he is going, but the fool walks in darkness.<br>
Yet I also realized that the same fate happens to them both.<br>
[15] So I thought to myself, “The fate of the fool will happen even to me!<br>
Then what did I gain by becoming so excessively wise?”<br>
So I lamented to myself,<br>
“The benefits of wisdom are ultimately meaningless!”<br>
[16] For the wise man, like the fool, will not be remembered for very long,<br>
because in the days to come, both will already have been forgotten.<br>
Alas, the wise man dies—just like the fool!<br>
[17] So I loathed life because what<br>
happens on earth seems awful to me;<br>
for all the benefits of wisdom are futile—like chasing the wind.<br>

### Futility of Being a Workaholic

[18] So I loathed all the fruit of my effort,<br>
for which I worked so hard on earth,<br>
because I must leave it behind in the hands of my successor.<br>
[19] Who knows if he will be a wise man or a fool?<br>
Yet he will be master over all the fruit of my labor<br>
for which I worked so wisely on earth.<br>
This also is futile!<br>
[20] So I began to despair about all the fruit of my labor<br>
for which I worked so hard on earth.<br>
[21] For a man may do his work with wisdom, knowledge, and skill;<br>
however, he must hand over the fruit of his labor as an inheritance<br>
to someone else who did not work for it.<br>
This also is futile, and an awful injustice!<br>

### Painful Days and Restless Nights

[22] What does a man acquire from all his labor<br>
and from the anxiety that accompanies his toil on earth?<br>
[23] For all day long his work produces pain and frustration,<br>
and even at night his mind cannot relax.<br>
This also is futile!<br>

### Enjoy Work and its Benefits

[24] There is nothing better for people than to eat and drink,<br>
and to find enjoyment in their work.<br>
I also perceived that this ability to find enjoyment comes from God.<br>
[25] For no one can eat and drink<br>
or experience joy apart from him.<br>
[26] For to the one who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy,<br>
but to the sinner, he gives the task of amassing wealth —<br>
only to give it to the one who pleases God.<br>
This task of the wicked is futile—like chasing the wind!<br>
## Chapter 3

### A Time for All Events in Life

[1] For everything there is an appointed time,<br>
and an appropriate time for every activity on earth:<br>
[2] A time to be born, and a time to die;<br>
a time to plant, and a time to uproot what was planted;<br>
[3] a time to kill, and a time to heal;<br>
a time to break down, and a time to build up;<br>
[4] a time to weep, and a time to laugh;<br>
a time to mourn, and a time to dance.<br>
[5] A time to throw away stones, and a time to gather stones;<br>
a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;<br>
[6] a time to search, and a time to give something up as lost;<br>
a time to keep, and a time to throw away;<br>
[7] a time to rip, and a time to sew;<br>
a time to keep silent, and a time to speak.<br>
[8] A time to love, and a time to hate;<br>
a time for war, and a time for peace.<br>

### Man is Ignorant of God’s Timing

[9] What benefit can a worker gain from his toil?<br>
[10] I have observed the burden<br>
that God has given to people to keep them occupied.<br>
[11] God has made everything fit beautifully in its appropriate time,<br>
but he has also placed ignorance in the human heart<br>
so that people cannot discover what God has ordained,<br>
from the beginning to the end of their lives.<br>

### Enjoy Life in the Present

[12] I have concluded that there is nothing better for people<br>
than to be happy and to enjoy<br>
themselves as long as they live,<br>
[13] and also that everyone should eat and drink, and find enjoyment in all his toil,<br>
for these things are a gift from God.<br>

### God’s Sovereignty

[14] I also know that whatever God does will endure forever;<br>
nothing can be added to it, and nothing taken away from it.<br>
God has made it this way, so that men will fear him.<br>
[15] Whatever exists now has already been, and whatever will be has already been;<br>
for God will seek to do again what has occurred in the past.<br>

### The Problem of Injustice and Oppression

[16] I saw something else on earth:<br>
In the place of justice, there was wickedness,<br>
and in the place of fairness, there was wickedness.<br>
[17] I thought to myself, “God will judge both the righteous and the wicked;<br>
for there is an appropriate time for every activity,<br>
and there is a time of judgment for every deed.”<br>
[18] I also thought to myself, “It is for the sake of people,<br>
so God can clearly show them that they are like animals.<br>
[19] For the fate of humans and the fate of animals are the same:<br>
As one dies, so dies the other; both have the same breath.<br>
There is no advantage for humans over animals,<br>
for both are fleeting.<br>
[20] Both go to the same place,<br>
both come from the dust,<br>
and to dust both return.<br>
[21] Who really knows if the human spirit ascends upward,<br>
and the animal’s spirit descends into the earth?”<br>
[22] So I perceived there is nothing better than for people to enjoy their work,<br>
because that is their reward;<br>
for who can show them what the future holds?<br>
## Chapter 4

### Evil Oppression on Earth

[1] So I again considered all the oppression that continually occurs on earth.<br>
This is what I saw:<br>
The oppressed were in tears, but no one was comforting them;<br>
no one delivers them from the power of their oppressors.<br>
[2] So I considered those who are dead and gone<br>
more fortunate than those who are still alive.<br>
[3] But better than both is the one who has not been born<br>
and has not seen the evil things that are done on earth.<br>

### Labor Motivated by Envy

[4] Then I considered all the skillful work that is done:<br>
Surely it is nothing more than competition between one person and another.<br>
This also is profitless—like chasing the wind.<br>
[5] The fool folds his hands and does no work,<br>
so he has nothing to eat but his own flesh.<br>
[6] Better is one handful with some rest<br>
than two hands full of toil and chasing the wind.<br>

### Labor Motivated by Greed

[7] So I again considered another futile thing on earth:<br>
[8] A man who is all alone with no companion,<br>
he has no children nor siblings;<br>
yet there is no end to all his toil,<br>
and he is never satisfied with riches.<br>
He laments, “For whom am I toiling and depriving myself of pleasure?”<br>
This also is futile and a burdensome task!<br>

### Labor is Beneficial When Its Rewards Are Shared

[9] Two people are better than one,<br>
because they can reap more benefit from their labor.<br>
[10] For if they fall, one will help his companion up,<br>
but pity the person who falls down and has no one to help him up.<br>
[11] Furthermore, if two lie down together, they can keep each other warm,<br>
but how can one person keep warm by himself?<br>
[12] Although an assailant may overpower one person,<br>
two can withstand him.<br>
Moreover, a three-stranded cord is not quickly broken.<br>

### Labor Motivated by Prestige Seeking

[13] A poor but wise youth is better than an old and foolish king<br>
who no longer knows how to receive advice.<br>
[14] For he came out of prison to become king,<br>
even though he had been born poor in what would become his kingdom.<br>
[15] I considered all the living who walk on earth,<br>
as well as the successor who would arise in his place.<br>
[16] There is no end to all the people nor to the past generations,<br>
yet future generations will not rejoice in him.<br>
This also is profitless and like chasing the wind.<br>
## Chapter 5

### Rash Vows

[1] (4:17) Be careful what you do when you go to the temple of God;<br>
draw near to listen rather than to offer a sacrifice like fools,<br>
for they do not realize that they are doing wrong.<br>
[2] (5:1) Do not be rash with your mouth or hasty in your heart to bring up a matter before God,<br>
for God is in heaven and you are on earth!<br>
Therefore, let your words be few.<br>
[3] Just as dreams come when there are many cares,<br>
so the rash vow of a fool occurs when there are many words.<br>
[4] When you make a vow to God, do not delay in paying it.<br>
For God takes no pleasure in fools:<br>
Pay what you vow!<br>
[5] It is better for you not to vow<br>
than to vow and not pay it.<br>
[6] Do not let your mouth cause you to sin,<br>
and do not tell the priest, “It was a mistake!”<br>
Why make God angry at you<br>
so that he would destroy the work of your hands?<br>
[7] Just as there is futility in many dreams,<br>
so also in many words.<br>
Therefore, fear God.<br>

### Government Corruption

[8] If you see the extortion of the poor,<br>
or the perversion of justice and fairness in the government,<br>
do not be astonished by the matter.<br>
For the high official is watched by a higher official,<br>
and there are higher ones over them!<br>
[9] The produce of the land is seized by all of them,<br>
even the king is served by the fields.<br>

### Covetousness

[10] The one who loves money will never be satisfied with money,<br>
he who loves wealth will never be satisfied with his income.<br>
This also is futile.<br>
[11] When someone’s prosperity increases, those who consume it also increase;<br>
so what does its owner gain, except that he gets to see it with his eyes?<br>
[12] The sleep of the laborer is pleasant—whether he eats little or much—<br>
but the wealth of the rich will not allow him to sleep.<br>

### Materialism Thwarts Enjoyment of Life

[13] Here is a misfortune on earth that I have seen:<br>
Wealth hoarded by its owner to his own misery.<br>
[14] Then that wealth was lost through bad luck;<br>
although he fathered a son, he has nothing left to give him.<br>
[15] Just as he came forth from his mother’s womb, naked will he return as he came,<br>
and he will take nothing in his hand that he may carry away from his toil.<br>
[16] This is another misfortune:<br>
Just as he came, so will he go.<br>
What did he gain from toiling for the wind?<br>
[17] Surely, he ate in darkness every day of his life,<br>
and he suffered greatly with sickness and anger.<br>

### Enjoy the Fruit of Your Labor

[18] I have seen personally what is the only beneficial and appropriate course of action for people:<br>
to eat and drink, and find enjoyment in all their hard work on earth<br>
during the few days of their life that God has given them,<br>
for this is their reward.<br>
[19] To every man whom God has given wealth and possessions,<br>
he has also given him the ability<br>
to eat from them, to receive his reward, and to find enjoyment in his toil;<br>
these things are the gift of God.<br>
[20] For he does not think much about the fleeting days of his life<br>
because God keeps him preoccupied with the joy he derives from his activity.<br>
## Chapter 6

### Not Everyone Enjoys Life

[1] Here is another misfortune that I have seen on earth,<br>
and it weighs heavily on people:<br>
[2] God gives a man riches, property, and wealth<br>
so that he lacks nothing that his heart desires,<br>
yet God does not enable him to enjoy the fruit of his labor —<br>
instead, someone else enjoys it!<br>
This is fruitless and a grave misfortune.<br>
[3] Even if a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years,<br>
even if he lives a long, long time, but cannot enjoy his prosperity—<br>
even if he were to live forever —<br>
I would say, “A stillborn child is better off than he is.”<br>
[4] Though the stillborn child came into the world for no reason and departed into darkness,<br>
though its name is shrouded in darkness,<br>
[5] though it never saw the light of day nor knew anything,<br>
yet it has more rest than that man—<br>
[6] if he should live a thousand years twice, yet does not enjoy his prosperity.<br>
For both of them die!<br>
[7] All man’s labor is for nothing more than to fill his stomach —<br>
yet his appetite is never satisfied!<br>
[8] So what advantage does a wise man have over a fool?<br>
And what advantage does a pauper gain by knowing how to survive?<br>
[9] It is better to be content with what the eyes can see<br>
than for one’s heart always to crave more.<br>
This continual longing is futile—like chasing the wind.<br>

### The Futile Way Life Works

[10] Whatever has happened was foreordained,<br>
and what happens to a person was also foreknown.<br>
It is useless for him to argue with God about his fate<br>
because God is more powerful than he is.<br>
[11] The more one argues with words, the less he accomplishes.<br>
How does that benefit him?<br>
[12] For no one knows what is best for a person during his life —<br>
during the few days of his fleeting life—<br>
for they pass away like a shadow.<br>
Nor can anyone tell him what the future will hold for him on earth.<br>
## Chapter 7

### Life is Brief and Death is Certain

[1] A good reputation is better than precious perfume;<br>
likewise, the day of one’s death is better than the day of one’s birth.<br>
[2] It is better to go to a funeral<br>
than a feast.<br>
For death is the destiny of every person,<br>
and the living should take this to heart.<br>
[3] Sorrow is better than laughter,<br>
because sober reflection is good for the heart.<br>
[4] The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning,<br>
but the heart of fools is in the house of merrymaking.<br>

### Frivolous Living Versus Wisdom

[5] It is better for a person to receive a rebuke from those who are wise<br>
than to listen to the song of fools.<br>
[6] For like the crackling of quick-burning thorns under a cooking pot,<br>
so is the laughter of the fool.<br>
This kind of folly also is useless.<br>

### Human Wisdom Overturned by Adversity

[7] Surely oppression can turn a wise person into a fool;<br>
likewise, a bribe corrupts the heart.<br>
[8] The end of a matter is better than its beginning;<br>
likewise, patience is better than pride.<br>
[9] Do not let yourself be quickly provoked,<br>
for anger resides in the lap of fools.<br>
[10] Do not say, “Why were the old days better than these days?”<br>
for it is not wise to ask that.<br>

### Wisdom Can Lengthen One’s Life

[11] Wisdom, like an inheritance, is a good thing;<br>
it benefits those who see the light of day.<br>
[12] For wisdom provides protection,<br>
just as money provides protection.<br>
But the advantage of knowledge is this:<br>
Wisdom preserves the life of its owner.<br>

### Wisdom Acknowledges God’s Orchestration of Life

[13] Consider the work of God:<br>
For who can make straight what he has bent?<br>
[14] In times of prosperity be joyful,<br>
but in times of adversity consider this:<br>
God has made one as well as the other,<br>
so that no one can discover what the future holds.<br>

### Exceptions to the Law of Retribution

[15] During the days of my fleeting life I have seen both of these things:<br>
Sometimes a righteous person dies prematurely in spite of his righteousness,<br>
and sometimes a wicked person lives long in spite of his evil deeds.<br>
[16] So do not be excessively righteous or excessively wise;<br>
otherwise you might be disappointed.<br>
[17] Do not be excessively wicked and do not be a fool;<br>
otherwise you might die before your time.<br>
[18] It is best to take hold of one warning without letting go of the other warning;<br>
for the one who fears God will follow both warnings.<br>

### Wisdom Needed Because No One is Truly Righteous

[19] Wisdom gives a wise person more protection<br>
than ten rulers in a city.<br>
[20] For there is not one truly righteous person on the earth<br>
who continually does good and never sins.<br>
[21] Also, do not pay attention to everything that people say;<br>
otherwise, you might even hear your servant cursing you.<br>
[22] For you know in your own heart<br>
that you also have cursed others many times.<br>

### Human Wisdom is Limited

[23] I have examined all this by wisdom;<br>
I said, “I am determined to comprehend this” —but it was beyond my grasp.<br>
[24] Whatever has happened is beyond human understanding;<br>
it is far deeper than anyone can fathom.<br>

### True Righteousness and Wisdom Are Virtually Nonexistent

[25] I tried to understand, examine, and comprehend<br>
the role of wisdom in the scheme of things,<br>
and to understand the stupidity of wickedness and the insanity of folly.<br>
[26] I discovered this:<br>
More bitter than death is the kind of woman who is like a hunter’s snare;<br>
her heart is like a hunter’s net and her hands are like prison chains.<br>
The man who pleases God escapes her,<br>
but the sinner is captured by her.<br>
[27] The Teacher says:<br>
I discovered this while trying to discover the scheme of things, item by item.<br>
[28] What I have continually sought, I have not found;<br>
I have found only one upright man among a thousand,<br>
but I have not found one upright woman among all of them.<br>
[29] This alone have I discovered: God made humankind upright,<br>
but they have sought many evil schemes.<br>
## Chapter 8

### Human Government Demonstrates Limitations of Wisdom

[1] Who is a wise person? Who knows the solution to a problem?<br>
A person’s wisdom brightens his appearance, and softens his harsh countenance.<br>
[2] Obey the king’s command,<br>
because you took an oath before God to be loyal to him.<br>
[3] Do not rush out of the king’s presence in haste—do not delay when the matter is unpleasant,<br>
for he can do whatever he pleases.<br>
[4] Surely the king’s authority is absolute;<br>
no one can say to him, “What are you doing?”<br>
[5] Whoever obeys his command will not experience harm,<br>
and a wise person knows the proper time and procedure.<br>
[6] For there is a proper time and procedure for every matter,<br>
for the oppression of the king is severe upon his victim.<br>
[7] Surely no one knows the future,<br>
and no one can tell another person what will happen.<br>
[8] Just as no one has power over the wind to restrain it,<br>
so no one has power over the day of his death.<br>
Just as no one can be discharged during the battle,<br>
so wickedness cannot rescue the wicked.<br>
[9] While applying my mind to everything that happens in this world, I have seen all this:<br>
Sometimes one person dominates other people to their harm.<br>

### Contradictions to the Law of Retribution

[10] Not only that, but I have seen the wicked approaching and entering the temple,<br>
and as they left the holy temple, they<br>
boasted in the city that they had done so.<br>
This also is an enigma.<br>
[11] When a sentence is not executed at once against a crime,<br>
the human heart is encouraged to do evil.<br>
[12] Even though a sinner might commit a hundred crimes and still live a long time,<br>
yet I know that it will go well with God-fearing people —for they stand in fear before him.<br>
[13] But it will not go well with the wicked,<br>
nor will they prolong their days like a shadow,<br>
because they do not stand in fear before God.<br>
[14] Here is another enigma that occurs on earth:<br>
Sometimes there are righteous people who get what the wicked deserve,<br>
and sometimes there are wicked people who get what the righteous deserve.<br>
I said, “This also is an enigma.”<br>

### Enjoy Life In Spite of Its Injustices

[15] So I recommend the enjoyment of life,<br>
for there is nothing better on earth for a person to do except to eat, drink, and enjoy life.<br>
So joy will accompany him in his toil<br>
during the days of his life that God gives him on earth.<br>

### Limitations of Human Wisdom

[16] When I tried to gain wisdom<br>
and to observe the activity on earth—<br>
even though it prevents anyone from sleeping day or night —<br>
[17] then I discerned all that God has done:<br>
No one really comprehends what happens on earth.<br>
Despite all human efforts to discover it, no one can ever grasp it.<br>
Even if a wise person claimed that he understood,<br>
he would not really comprehend it.<br>
## Chapter 9

### Everyone Will Die

[1] So I reflected on all this, attempting to clear it all up.<br>
I concluded that the righteous and the wise, as well as their works, are in the hand of God;<br>
whether a person will be loved or hated —<br>
no one knows what lies ahead.<br>
[2] Everyone shares the same fate —<br>
the righteous and the wicked,<br>
the good and the bad,<br>
the ceremonially clean and unclean,<br>
those who offer sacrifices and those who do not.<br>
What happens to the good person, also happens to the sinner;<br>
what happens to those who make vows, also happens to those who are afraid to make vows.<br>
[3] This is the unfortunate fact about everything that happens on earth:<br>
the same fate awaits everyone.<br>
In addition to this, the hearts of all people are full of evil,<br>
and there is folly in their hearts during their lives—then they die.<br>

### Better to Be Poor but Alive than Rich but Dead

[4] But whoever is among the living has hope;<br>
a live dog is better than a dead lion.<br>
[5] For the living know that they will die, but the dead do not know anything;<br>
they have no further reward—and even the memory of them disappears.<br>
[6] What they loved, as well as what they hated and envied, perished long ago,<br>
and they no longer have a part in anything that happens on earth.<br>

### Life is Brief, so Cherish its Joys

[7] Go, eat your food with joy,<br>
and drink your wine with a happy heart,<br>
because God has already approved your works.<br>
[8] Let your clothes always be white,<br>
and do not spare precious ointment on your head.<br>
[9] Enjoy life with your beloved wife during all the days of your fleeting life<br>
that God has given you on earth during all your fleeting days;<br>
for that is your reward in life and in your burdensome work on earth.<br>
[10] Whatever you find to do with your hands,<br>
do it with all your might,<br>
because there is neither work nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave,<br>
the place where you will eventually go.<br>

### Wisdom Cannot Protect against Seemingly Chance Events

[11] Again, I observed this on the earth:<br>
the race is not always won by the swiftest,<br>
the battle is not always won by the strongest;<br>
prosperity does not always belong to those who are the wisest,<br>
wealth does not always belong to those who are the most discerning,<br>
nor does success always come to those with the most knowledge—<br>
for time and chance may overcome them all.<br>
[12] Surely, no one knows his appointed time.<br>
Like fish that are caught in a deadly net, and like birds that are caught in a snare—<br>
just like them, all people are ensnared at an unfortunate time that falls upon them suddenly.<br>

### Most People Are Not Receptive to Wise Counsel

[13] This is what I also observed about wisdom on earth,<br>
and it is a great burden to me:<br>
[14] There was once a small city with a few men in it,<br>
and a mighty king attacked it, besieging it and building strong siege works against it.<br>
[15] However, a poor but wise man lived in the city,<br>
and he could have delivered the city by his wisdom,<br>
but no one listened to that poor man.<br>
[16] So I concluded that wisdom is better than might,<br>
but a poor man’s wisdom is despised; no one ever listens to his advice.<br>

### Wisdom versus Fools, Sin, and Folly

[17] The words of the wise are heard in quiet,<br>
more than the shouting of a ruler is heard among fools.<br>
[18] Wisdom is better than weapons of war,<br>
but one sinner can destroy much that is good.<br>
## Chapter 10

[1] One dead fly makes the perfumer’s ointment give off a rancid stench,<br>
so a little folly can outweigh much wisdom.<br>

### Wisdom Can Be Nullified By the Caprice of Rulers

[2] A wise person’s good sense protects him,<br>
but a fool’s lack of sense leaves him vulnerable.<br>
[3] Even when a fool walks along the road he lacks sense,<br>
and shows everyone what a fool he is.<br>
[4] If the anger of the ruler flares up against you, do not resign from your position,<br>
for a calm response can undo great offenses.<br>
[5] I have seen another misfortune on the earth:<br>
It is an error a ruler makes.<br>
[6] Fools are placed in many positions of authority,<br>
while wealthy men sit in lowly positions.<br>
[7] I have seen slaves on horseback<br>
and princes walking on foot like slaves.<br>

### Wisdom is Needed to Avert Dangers in Everyday Life

[8] One who digs a pit may fall into it,<br>
and one who breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.<br>
[9] One who quarries stones may be injured by them;<br>
one who splits logs may be endangered by them.<br>
[10] If an iron axhead is blunt and a workman does not sharpen its edge,<br>
he must exert a great deal of effort;<br>
so wisdom has the advantage of giving success.<br>
[11] If the snake should bite before it is charmed,<br>
the snake charmer is in trouble.<br>

### Words and Works of Wise Men and Fools

[12] The words of a wise person win him favor,<br>
but the words of a fool are self-destructive.<br>
[13] At the beginning his words are foolish<br>
and at the end his talk is wicked madness,<br>
[14] yet a fool keeps on babbling.<br>
No one knows what will happen;<br>
who can tell him what will happen in the future?<br>
[15] The toil of a stupid fool wears him out,<br>
because he does not even know the way to the city.<br>

### The Problem with Foolish Rulers

[16] Woe to you, O land, when your king is childish,<br>
and your princes feast in the morning.<br>
[17] Blessed are you, O land, when your king is the son of nobility,<br>
and your princes feast at the proper time —with self-control and not in drunkenness.<br>
[18] Because of laziness the roof caves in,<br>
and because of idle hands the house leaks.<br>
[19] Feasts are made for laughter,<br>
and wine makes life merry,<br>
but money is the answer for everything.<br>
[20] Do not curse a king even in your thoughts,<br>
and do not curse the rich while in your bedroom;<br>
for a bird might report what you are thinking,<br>
or some winged creature might repeat your words.<br>
## Chapter 11

### Ignorance of the Future Demands Diligence in the Present

[1] Send your grain overseas,<br>
for after many days you will get a return.<br>
[2] Divide your merchandise among seven or even eight investments,<br>
for you do not know what calamity may happen on earth.<br>
[3] If the clouds are full of rain, they will empty themselves on the earth,<br>
and whether a tree falls to the south or to the north, the tree will lie wherever it falls.<br>
[4] He who watches the wind will not sow,<br>
and he who observes the clouds will not reap.<br>
[5] Just as you do not know the path of the wind,<br>
or how the bones form in the womb of a pregnant woman,<br>
so you do not know the work of God who makes everything.<br>
[6] Sow your seed in the morning,<br>
and do not stop working until the evening;<br>
for you do not know which activity will succeed —<br>
whether this one or that one, or whether both will prosper equally.<br>

### Life Should Be Enjoyed Because Death is Inevitable

[7] Light is sweet,<br>
and it is pleasant for a person to see the sun.<br>
[8] So, if a man lives many years, let him rejoice in them all,<br>
but let him remember that the days of darkness will be many—all that is about to come is obscure.<br>

### Enjoy Life to the Fullest under the Fear of God

[9] Rejoice, young man, while you are young,<br>
and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth.<br>
Follow the impulses of your heart and the desires of your eyes,<br>
but know that God will judge your motives and actions.<br>
[10] Banish emotional stress from your mind.<br>
and put away pain from your body;<br>
for youth and the prime of life are fleeting.<br>
## Chapter 12

### Fear God Now Because Old Age and Death Come Quickly

[1] So remember your Creator in the days of your youth—<br>
before the difficult days come,<br>
and the years draw near when you will say, “I have no pleasure in them”;<br>
[2] before the sun and the light of the moon and the stars grow dark,<br>
and the clouds disappear after the rain;<br>
[3] when those who keep watch over the house begin to tremble,<br>
and the virile men begin to stoop over,<br>
and the grinders begin to cease because they grow few,<br>
and those who look through the windows grow dim,<br>
[4] and the doors along the street are shut;<br>
when the sound of the grinding mill grows low,<br>
and one is awakened by the sound of a bird,<br>
and all their songs grow faint,<br>
[5] and they are afraid of heights and the dangers in the street;<br>
the almond blossoms grow white,<br>
and the grasshopper drags itself along,<br>
and the caper berry shrivels up —<br>
because man goes to his eternal home,<br>
and the mourners go about in the streets—<br>
[6] before the silver cord is removed,<br>
or the golden bowl is broken,<br>
or the pitcher is shattered at the well,<br>
or the water wheel is broken at the cistern—<br>
[7] and the dust returns to the earth as it was,<br>
and the life’s breath returns to God who gave it.<br>

### Concluding Refrain: The Teacher Restates His Thesis

[8] “Absolutely futile!” laments the Teacher,<br>
“All these things are futile!”<br>

### Concluding Epilogue: The Teacher’s Advice is Wise

[9] Not only was the Teacher wise,<br>
but he also taught knowledge to the people;<br>
he carefully evaluated and arranged many proverbs.<br>
[10] The Teacher sought to find delightful words,<br>
and to write accurately truthful sayings.<br>
[11] The words of the sages are like prods,<br>
and the collected sayings are like firmly fixed nails;<br>
they are given by one shepherd.<br>

### Concluding Exhortation: Fear God and Obey His Commands

[12] Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them.<br>
There is no end to the making of many books,<br>
and much study is exhausting to the body.<br>
[13] Having heard everything, I have reached this conclusion:<br>
Fear God and keep his commandments,<br>
because this is the whole duty of man.<br>
[14] For God will evaluate every deed,<br>
including every secret thing, whether good or evil.<br>
