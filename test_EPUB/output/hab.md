# Habakkuk

## Chapter 1

### Habakkuk Complains to the Lord

[1] This is the oracle that the prophet Habakkuk saw:

[2] How long, **Lord**, must I cry for help?<br>
But you do not listen!<br>
I call out to you, “Violence!”<br>
But you do not deliver!<br>
[3] Why do you force me to witness injustice?<br>
Why do you put up with wrongdoing?<br>
Destruction and violence confront me;<br>
conflict is present and one must endure strife.<br>
[4] For this reason the law lacks power,<br>
and justice is never carried out.<br>
Indeed, the wicked intimidate the innocent.<br>
For this reason justice is perverted.<br>
### The Lord’s Surprising Answer

[5] “Look at the nations and pay attention!<br>
You will be shocked and amazed!<br>
For I will do something in your lifetime<br>
that you will not believe even though you are forewarned.<br>
[6] Look, I am about to empower the Babylonians,<br>
that ruthless and greedy nation.<br>
They sweep across the surface of the earth,<br>
seizing dwelling places that do not belong to them.<br>
[7] They are frightening and terrifying;<br>
they decide for themselves what is right.<br>
[8] Their horses are faster than leopards<br>
and more alert than wolves in the desert.<br>
Their horses gallop,<br>
their horses come a great distance;<br>
like vultures they swoop down quickly to devour their prey.<br>
[9] All of them intend to do violence;<br>
every face is determined.<br>
They take prisoners as easily as one scoops up sand.<br>
[10] They mock kings<br>
and laugh at rulers.<br>
They laugh at every fortified city;<br>
they build siege ramps and capture them.<br>
[11] They sweep by like the wind and pass on.<br>
But the one who considers himself a god will be held guilty.”<br>
### Habakkuk Voices Some Concerns

[12] **Lord**, you have been active from ancient times;<br>
my sovereign God, you are immortal.<br>
**Lord**, you have made them your instrument of judgment.<br>
Protector, you have appointed them as your instrument of punishment.<br>
[13] You are too just to tolerate evil;<br>
you are unable to condone wrongdoing.<br>
So why do you put up with such treacherous people?<br>
Why do you say nothing when the wicked devour those more righteous than they are?<br>
[14] You made people like fish in the sea,<br>
like animals in the sea that have no ruler.<br>
[15] The Babylonian tyrant pulls them all up with a fishhook;<br>
he hauls them in with his throw net.<br>
When he catches them in his dragnet,<br>
he is very happy.<br>
[16] Because of his success he offers sacrifices to his throw net<br>
and burns incense to his dragnet;<br>
for because of them he has plenty of food,<br>
and more than enough to eat.<br>
[17] Will he then continue to fill and empty his throw net?<br>
Will he always destroy nations and spare none?<br>
## Chapter 2


[1] I will stand at my watch post;<br>
I will remain stationed on the city wall.<br>
I will keep watching so I can see what he says to me<br>
and can know how I should answer<br>
when he counters my argument.<br>
### The Lord Assures Habakkuk

[2] The **Lord** responded:

“Write down this message.<br>
Record it legibly on tablets<br>
so the one who announces it may read it easily.<br>
[3] For the message is a witness to what is decreed;<br>
it gives reliable testimony about how matters will turn out.<br>
Even if the message is not fulfilled right away, wait patiently;<br>
for it will certainly come to pass—it will not arrive late.<br>
[4] Look, the one whose desires are not upright will faint from exhaustion,<br>
but the person of integrity will live because of his faithfulness.<br>
[5] Indeed, wine will betray the proud, restless man!<br>
His appetite is as big as Sheol’s;<br>
like death, he is never satisfied.<br>
He gathers all the nations;<br>
he seizes all peoples.<br>
### The Proud Babylonians Are as Good as Dead

[6] “But all these nations will someday taunt him<br>
and ridicule him with proverbial sayings:<br>
‘Woe to the one who accumulates what does not belong to him<br>
(How long will this go on?) —<br>
he who gets rich by extortion!’<br>
[7] Your creditors will suddenly attack;<br>
those who terrify you will spring into action,<br>
and they will rob you.<br>
[8] Because you robbed many countries,<br>
all who are left among the nations will rob you.<br>
You have shed human blood<br>
and committed violent acts against lands, cities, and those who live in them.<br>

[9] The one who builds his house by unjust gain is as good as dead.<br>
He does this so he can build his nest way up high<br>
and escape the clutches of disaster.<br>
[10] Your schemes will bring shame to your house.<br>
Because you destroyed many nations, you will self-destruct.<br>
[11] For the stones in the walls will cry out,<br>
and the wooden rafters will answer back.<br>

[12] Woe to the one who builds a city by bloodshed—<br>
he who starts a town by unjust deeds.<br>
[13] Be sure of this! The **Lord** of Heaven’s Armies has decreed:<br>
The nations’ efforts will go up in smoke;<br>
their exhausting work will be for nothing.<br>
[14] For recognition of the **Lord**’s sovereign majesty will fill the earth<br>
just as the waters fill up the sea.<br>


[15] “Woe to you who force your neighbor to drink wine —<br>
you who make others intoxicated<br>
by forcing them to drink from the bowl of your furious anger<br>
so you can look at their naked bodies.<br>
[16] But you will become drunk with shame, not majesty.<br>
Now it is your turn to drink and expose your uncircumcised foreskin!<br>
The cup of wine in the **Lord**’s right hand is coming to you,<br>
and disgrace will replace your majestic glory!<br>
[17] For you will pay in full for your violent acts against Lebanon;<br>
terrifying judgment will come upon you<br>
because of the way you destroyed the wild animals living there.<br>
You have shed human blood<br>
and committed violent acts against lands, cities, and those who live in them.<br>
[18] What good is an idol? Why would a craftsman make it?<br>
What good is a metal image that gives misleading oracles?<br>
Why would its creator place his trust in it<br>
and make such mute, worthless things?<br>
[19] Woe to the one who says to wood, ‘Wake up!’—<br>
he who says to speechless stone, ‘Awake!’<br>
Can it give reliable guidance?<br>
It is overlaid with gold and silver;<br>
it has no life’s breath inside it.<br>
[20] But the **Lord** is in his majestic palace.<br>
The whole earth is speechless in his presence!”<br>
## Chapter 3

### Habakkuk’s Vision of the Divine Warrior

[1] This is a prayer of Habakkuk the prophet:

[2] **Lord**, I have heard the report of what you did;<br>
I am awed, **Lord**, by what you accomplished.<br>
In our time repeat those deeds;<br>
in our time reveal them again.<br>
But when you cause turmoil, remember to show us mercy!<br>
[3] God comes from Teman,<br>
the Holy One from Mount Paran. _Selah_.<br>
His splendor has covered the skies,<br>
the earth is full of his glory.<br>
[4] His brightness will be as lightning;<br>
a two-pronged lightning bolt flashing from his hand.<br>
This is the outward display of his power.<br>
[5] Plague will go before him;<br>
pestilence will march right behind him.<br>
[6] He took his battle position and shook the earth;<br>
with a mere look he frightened the nations.<br>
The ancient mountains disintegrated;<br>
the primeval hills were flattened.<br>
His are ancient roads.<br>
[7] I saw the tents of Cushan overwhelmed by trouble;<br>
the tent curtains of the land of Midian were shaking.<br>
[8] Was the **Lord** mad at the rivers?<br>
Were you angry with the rivers?<br>
Were you enraged at the sea?<br>
Such that you would climb into your horse-drawn chariots,<br>
your victorious chariots?<br>
[9] Your bow is ready for action;<br>
you commission your arrows. _Selah_.<br>
You cause flash floods on the earth’s surface.<br>
[10] When the mountains see you, they shake.<br>
The torrential downpour sweeps through.<br>
The great deep shouts out;<br>
it lifts its hands high.<br>
[11] The sun and moon stand still in their courses;<br>
the flash of your arrows drives them away,<br>
the bright light of your lightning-quick spear.<br>
[12] You furiously stomp on the earth;<br>
you angrily trample down the nations.<br>
[13] You march out to deliver your people,<br>
to deliver your special servant.<br>
You strike the leader of the wicked nation,<br>
laying him open from the lower body to the neck. _Selah_.<br>
[14] You pierce the heads of his warriors with a spear.<br>
They storm forward to scatter us;<br>
they shout with joy as if they were plundering the poor with no opposition.<br>
[15] But you trample on the sea with your horses,<br>
on the surging, raging waters.<br>
### Habakkuk Declares His Confidence

[16] I listened and my stomach churned;<br>
the sound made my lips quiver.<br>
My frame went limp, as if my bones were decaying,<br>
and I shook as I tried to walk.<br>
I long for the day of distress<br>
to come upon the people who attack us.<br>
[17] When the fig tree does not bud,<br>
and there are no grapes on the vines;<br>
when the olive trees do not produce<br>
and the fields yield no crops;<br>
when the sheep disappear from the pen<br>
and there are no cattle in the stalls—<br>
[18] I will rejoice because of the **Lord**;<br>
I will be happy because of the God who delivers me!<br>
[19] The Sovereign **Lord** is my source of strength.<br>
He gives me the agility of a deer;<br>
he enables me to negotiate the rugged terrain.<br>
(This prayer is for the song leader. It is to be accompanied by stringed instruments.)
