# Lamentations

## Chapter 1

### The Prophet Speaks

#### א (Alef)

[1] Alas! The city once full of people<br>
now sits all alone!<br>
The prominent lady among the nations<br>
has become a widow!<br>
The princess who once ruled the provinces<br>
has become a forced laborer!<br>
#### ב (Bet)

[2] She weeps bitterly at night;<br>
tears stream down her cheeks.<br>
She has no one to comfort her<br>
among all her lovers.<br>
All her friends have betrayed her;<br>
they have become her enemies.<br>
#### ג (Gimel)

[3] Judah has departed into exile<br>
under affliction and harsh oppression.<br>
She lives among the nations;<br>
she has found no resting place.<br>
All who pursued her overtook her<br>
in narrow straits.<br>
#### ד (Dalet)

[4] The roads to Zion mourn<br>
because no one travels to the festivals.<br>
All her city gates are deserted;<br>
her priests groan.<br>
Her virgins grieve;<br>
she is in bitter anguish!<br>
#### ה (He)

[5] Her foes subjugated her;<br>
her enemies are at ease.<br>
For the **Lord** afflicted her<br>
because of her many acts of rebellion.<br>
Her children went away<br>
captive before the enemy.<br>
#### ו (Vav)

[6] All of Daughter Zion’s splendor<br>
has departed.<br>
Her leaders became like deer;<br>
they found no pasture,<br>
so they were too exhausted to escape<br>
from the hunter.<br>
#### ז (Zayin)

[7] Jerusalem remembers,<br>
when she became a poor homeless person,<br>
all her treasures<br>
that she owned in days of old.<br>
When her people fell into an enemy’s grip,<br>
none of her allies came to her rescue.<br>
Her enemies gloated over her;<br>
they sneered at her downfall.<br>
#### ח (Khet)

[8] Jerusalem committed terrible sin;<br>
therefore she became an object of scorn.<br>
All who admired her have despised her<br>
because they have seen her nakedness.<br>
She groans aloud<br>
and turns away in shame.<br>
#### ט (Tet)

[9] Her menstrual flow has soiled her clothing;<br>
she did not consider the consequences of her sin.<br>
Her demise was astonishing,<br>
and there was no one to comfort her.<br>
She cried, “Look, O **Lord**, on my affliction<br>
because my enemy boasts!”<br>
#### י (Yod)

[10] An enemy grabbed<br>
all her valuables.<br>
Indeed she watched in horror as Gentiles<br>
invaded her holy temple —<br>
those whom you had commanded:<br>
“They must not enter your assembly place.”<br>
#### כ (Kaf)

[11] All her people groaned<br>
as they searched for a morsel of bread.<br>
They exchanged their valuables<br>
for just enough food<br>
to stay alive.<br>
### Jerusalem Speaks

“Look, O **Lord**! Consider<br>
that I have become worthless!”<br>
#### ל (Lamed)

[12] Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by on the road?<br>
Look and see!<br>
Is there any pain like mine?<br>
The Lord has afflicted me,<br>
he has inflicted it on me<br>
when he burned with anger.<br>
#### מ (Mem)

[13] He sent down fire<br>
into my bones, and it overcame them.<br>
He spread out a trapper’s net for my feet;<br>
he made me turn back.<br>
He has made me desolate;<br>
I am faint all day long.<br>
#### נ (Nun)

[14] My sins are bound around my neck like a yoke;<br>
they are fastened together by his hand.<br>
He has placed his yoke on my neck;<br>
he has sapped my strength.<br>
The Lord has handed me over<br>
to those whom I cannot resist.<br>
#### ס (Samek)

[15] He rounded up all my mighty ones;<br>
The Lord did this in my midst.<br>
He summoned an assembly against me<br>
to shatter my young men.<br>
The Lord has stomped like grapes<br>
the virgin daughter, Judah.<br>
#### ע (Ayin)

[16] I weep because of these things;<br>
my eyes flow with tears.<br>
For there is no one in sight who can comfort me<br>
or encourage me.<br>
My children are desolated<br>
because an enemy has prevailed.<br>
#### פ (Pe)

### The Prophet Speaks

[17] Zion spread out her hands,<br>
but there is no one to comfort her.<br>
The **Lord** has issued a decree against Jacob;<br>
his neighbors have become his enemies.<br>
Jerusalem has become<br>
like filthy garbage in their midst.<br>
#### צ (Tsade)

### Jerusalem Speaks

[18] The **Lord** is right to judge me!<br>
Yes, I rebelled against his commands.<br>
Please listen, all you nations,<br>
and look at my suffering!<br>
My young women and men<br>
have gone into exile.<br>
#### ק (Qof)

[19] I called for my lovers,<br>
but they had deceived me.<br>
My priests and my elders<br>
perished in the city.<br>
Truly they had searched for food<br>
to keep themselves alive.<br>
#### ר (Resh)

[20] Look, O **Lord**! I am distressed;<br>
my stomach is in knots!<br>
My heart is pounding inside me.<br>
Yes, I was terribly rebellious!<br>
Out in the street the sword bereaves a mother of her children;<br>
Inside the house death is present.<br>
#### ש (Sin/Shin)

[21] They have heard that I groan,<br>
yet there is no one to comfort me.<br>
All my enemies have heard of my trouble;<br>
they are glad that you have brought it about.<br>
Bring about the day of judgment that you promised<br>
so that they may end up like me!<br>
#### ת (Tav)

[22] Let all their wickedness come before you;<br>
afflict them<br>
just as you have afflicted me<br>
because of all my acts of rebellion.<br>
For my groans are many,<br>
and my heart is sick with sorrow.<br>
## Chapter 2

#### א (Alef)

### The Prophet Speaks

[1] Alas! The Lord has covered<br>
Daughter Zion with his anger.<br>
He has thrown down the splendor of Israel<br>
from heaven to earth;<br>
he did not protect his temple<br>
when he displayed his anger.<br>
#### ב (Bet)

[2] The Lord destroyed mercilessly<br>
all the homes of Jacob’s descendants.<br>
In his anger he tore down<br>
the fortified cities of Daughter Judah.<br>
He knocked to the ground and humiliated<br>
the kingdom and its rulers.<br>
#### ג (Gimel)

[3] In fierce anger he destroyed<br>
the whole army of Israel.<br>
He withdrew his right hand<br>
as the enemy attacked.<br>
He was like a raging fire in the land of Jacob;<br>
it consumed everything around it.<br>
#### ד (Dalet)

[4] He prepared his bow like an enemy;<br>
his right hand was ready to shoot.<br>
Like a foe he killed everyone,<br>
even our strong young men;<br>
he has poured out his anger like fire<br>
on the tent of Daughter Zion.<br>
#### ה (He)

[5] The Lord, like an enemy,<br>
destroyed Israel.<br>
He destroyed all her palaces;<br>
he ruined her fortified cities.<br>
He made everyone in Daughter Judah<br>
mourn and lament.<br>
#### ו (Vav)

[6] He destroyed his temple as if it were a vineyard;<br>
he destroyed his appointed meeting place.<br>
The **Lord** has made those in Zion forget<br>
both the festivals and the Sabbaths.<br>
In his fierce anger he has spurned<br>
both king and priest.<br>
#### ז (Zayin)

[7] The Lord rejected his altar<br>
and abhorred his temple.<br>
He handed over to the enemy<br>
Jerusalem’s palace walls;<br>
the enemy shouted in the **Lord**’s temple<br>
as if it were a feast day.<br>
#### ח (Khet)

[8] The **Lord** was determined to tear down<br>
Daughter Zion’s wall.<br>
He prepared to knock it down;<br>
he did not withdraw his hand from destroying.<br>
He made the ramparts and fortified walls lament;<br>
together they mourned their ruin.<br>
#### ט (Tet)

[9] Her city gates have fallen to the ground;<br>
he smashed to bits the bars that lock her gates.<br>
Her king and princes were taken into exile;<br>
there is no more guidance available.<br>
As for her prophets,<br>
they no longer receive a vision from the **Lord**.<br>
#### י (Yod)

[10] The elders of Daughter Zion<br>
sit on the ground in silence.<br>
They have thrown dirt on their heads;<br>
They have dressed in sackcloth.<br>
Jerusalem’s young women stare down at the ground.<br>
#### כ (Kaf)

[11] My eyes are worn out from weeping;<br>
my stomach is in knots.<br>
My heart is poured out on the ground<br>
due to the destruction of my helpless people;<br>
children and infants faint<br>
in the town squares.<br>
#### ל (Lamed)

[12] Children say to their mothers,<br>
“Where are food and drink?”<br>
They faint like a wounded warrior<br>
in the city squares.<br>
They die slowly<br>
in their mothers’ arms.<br>
#### מ (Mem)

[13] With what can I equate you?<br>
To what can I compare you, O Daughter Jerusalem?<br>
To what can I liken you<br>
so that I might comfort you, O Virgin Daughter Zion?<br>
Your wound is as deep as the sea.<br>
Who can heal you?<br>
#### נ (Nun)

[14] Your prophets saw visions for you<br>
that were worthless whitewash.<br>
They failed to expose your sin<br>
so as to restore your fortunes.<br>
They saw oracles for you<br>
that were worthless lies.<br>
#### ס (Samek)

[15] All who passed by on the road<br>
clapped their hands to mock you.<br>
They sneered and shook their heads<br>
at Daughter Jerusalem.<br>
“Ha! Is this the city they called<br>
‘the perfection of beauty,<br>
the source of joy of the whole earth!’?”<br>
#### פ (Pe)

[16] All your enemies<br>
gloated over you.<br>
They sneered and gnashed their teeth;<br>
they said, “We have destroyed her!<br>
Ha! We have waited a long time for this day.<br>
We have lived to see it!”<br>
#### ע (Ayin)

[17] The **Lord** has done what he planned;<br>
he has fulfilled his promise<br>
that he threatened long ago:<br>
He has overthrown you without mercy<br>
and has enabled the enemy to gloat over you;<br>
he has exalted your adversaries’ power.<br>
#### צ (Tsade)

[18] Cry out from your heart to the Lord,<br>
O wall of Daughter Zion!<br>
Make your tears flow like a river<br>
all day and all night long!<br>
Do not rest;<br>
do not let your tears stop!<br>
#### ק (Qof)

[19] Get up! Cry out in the night<br>
when the night watches start!<br>
Pour out your heart like water<br>
before the face of the Lord!<br>
Lift up your hands to him<br>
for your children’s lives;<br>
they are fainting from hunger<br>
at every street corner.<br>
#### ר (Resh)

### Jerusalem Speaks

[20] Look, O **Lord!** Consider!<br>
Whom have you ever afflicted like this?<br>
Should women eat their offspring,<br>
their healthy infants?<br>
Should priest and prophet<br>
be killed in the Lord’s sanctuary?<br>
#### ש (Sin/Shin)

[21] The young boys and old men<br>
lie dead on the ground in the streets.<br>
My young women and my young men<br>
have fallen by the sword.<br>
You killed them when you were angry;<br>
you slaughtered them without mercy.<br>
#### ת (Tav)

[22] As if it were a feast day, you call<br>
enemies to terrify me on every side.<br>
On the day of the **Lord**’s anger<br>
no one escaped or survived.<br>
My enemy has finished off<br>
those healthy infants whom I bore and raised.<br>
## Chapter 3

#### א (Alef)

### The Prophet Speaks

[1] I am the man who has experienced affliction<br>
from the rod of the**Lord**’s wrath.<br>
[2] He drove me into captivity and made me walk<br>
in darkness and not light.<br>
[3] He repeatedly attacks me;<br>
he turns his hand against me all day long.<br>
#### ב (Bet)

[4] He has made my mortal skin waste away;<br>
he has broken my bones.<br>
[5] He has besieged and surrounded me<br>
with bitter hardship.<br>
[6] He has made me reside in deepest darkness<br>
like those who died long ago.<br>
#### ג (Gimel)

[7] He has walled me in so that I cannot get out;<br>
he has weighted me down with heavy prison chains.<br>
[8] Also, when I cry out desperately for help,<br>
he has shut out my prayer.<br>
[9] He has blocked every road I take with a wall of hewn stones;<br>
he has made every path impassable.<br>
#### ד (Dalet)

[10] To me he is like a bear lying in ambush,<br>
like a hidden lion stalking its prey.<br>
[11] He has obstructed my paths and torn me to pieces;<br>
he has made me desolate.<br>
[12] He drew his bow and made me<br>
the target for his arrow.<br>
#### ה (He)

[13] He shot his arrows<br>
into my heart.<br>
[14] I have become the laughingstock of all people,<br>
their mocking song all day long.<br>
[15] He has given me my fill of bitter herbs<br>
and made me drunk with bitterness.<br>
#### ו (Vav)

[16] He ground my teeth in gravel;<br>
he trampled me in the dust.<br>
[17] I am deprived of peace;<br>
I have forgotten what happiness is.<br>
[18] So I said, “My endurance has expired;<br>
I have lost all hope of deliverance from the **Lord**.”<br>
#### ז (Zayin)

[19] Remember my impoverished and homeless condition,<br>
which is a bitter poison.<br>
[20] I continually think about this,<br>
and I am depressed.<br>
[21] But this I call to mind;<br>
therefore I have hope:<br>
#### ח (Khet)

[22] The **Lord**’s loyal kindness never ceases;<br>
his compassions never end.<br>
[23] They are fresh every morning;<br>
your faithfulness is abundant!<br>
[24] “My portion is the **Lord**,” I have said to myself,<br>
so I will put my hope in him.<br>
#### ט (Tet)

[25] The **Lord** is good to those who trust in him,<br>
to the one who seeks him.<br>
[26] It is good to wait patiently<br>
for deliverance from the **Lord**.<br>
[27] It is good for a man<br>
to bear the yoke while he is young.<br>
#### י (Yod)

[28] Let a person sit alone in silence,<br>
when the **Lord** is disciplining him.<br>
[29] Let him bury his face in the dust;<br>
perhaps there is hope.<br>
[30] Let him offer his cheek to the one who hits him;<br>
let him have his fill of insults.<br>
#### כ (Kaf)

[31] For the Lord will not<br>
reject us forever.<br>
[32] Though he causes us grief, he then has compassion on us<br>
according to the abundance of his loyal kindness.<br>
[33] For he is not predisposed to afflict<br>
or to grieve people.<br>
#### ל (Lamed)

[34] To crush underfoot<br>
all the earth’s prisoners,<br>
[35] to deprive a person of his rights<br>
in the presence of the Most High,<br>
[36] to defraud a person in a lawsuit—<br>
the Lord does not approve of such things!<br>
#### מ (Mem)

[37] Whose command was ever fulfilled<br>
unless the Lord decreed it?<br>
[38] Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that everything comes—<br>
both calamity and blessing?<br>
[39] Why should any living person complain<br>
when punished for his sins?<br>
#### נ (Nun)

[40] Let us carefully examine our ways,<br>
and let us return to the **Lord**.<br>
[41] Let us lift up our hearts and our hands<br>
to God in heaven:<br>
[42] “We have blatantly rebelled;<br>
you have not forgiven.”<br>
#### ס (Samek)

[43] You shrouded yourself with anger and then pursued us;<br>
you killed without mercy.<br>
[44] You shrouded yourself with a cloud<br>
so that no prayer could get through.<br>
[45] You make us like filthy scum<br>
in the estimation of the nations.<br>
#### פ (Pe)

[46] All our enemies have gloated over us;<br>
[47] panic and pitfall have come upon us,<br>
devastation and destruction.<br>
[48] Streams of tears flow from my eyes<br>
because my people are destroyed.<br>
#### ע (Ayin)

[49] Tears flow from my eyes and will not stop;<br>
there will be no break<br>
[50] until the **Lord** looks down from heaven<br>
and sees what has happened.<br>
[51] What my eyes see grieves me —<br>
all the suffering of the daughters in my city.<br>
#### צ (Tsade)

[52] For no good reason my enemies<br>
hunted me down like a bird.<br>
[53] They shut me up in a pit<br>
and threw stones at me.<br>
[54] The waters closed over my head;<br>
I thought I was about to die.<br>
#### ק (Qof)

[55] I have called on your name, O **Lord**,<br>
from the deepest pit.<br>
[56] You heard my plea:<br>
“Do not close your ears to my cry for relief!”<br>
[57] You came near on the day I called to you;<br>
you said, “Do not fear!”<br>
#### ר (Resh)

[58] O Lord, you championed my cause;<br>
you redeemed my life.<br>
[59] You have seen the wrong done to me, O **Lord**;<br>
pronounce judgment on my behalf!<br>
[60] You have seen all their vengeance,<br>
all their plots against me.<br>
#### ש (Sin/Shin)

[61] You have heard their taunts, O **Lord**,<br>
all their plots against me.<br>
[62] My assailants revile and conspire<br>
against me all day long.<br>
[63] Watch them from morning to evening;<br>
I am the object of their mocking songs.<br>
#### ת (Tav)

[64] Pay them back what they deserve, O **Lord**,<br>
according to what they have done.<br>
[65] Give them a distraught heart;<br>
may your curse be on them!<br>
[66] Pursue them in anger and eradicate them<br>
from under the **Lord**’s heaven.<br>
## Chapter 4

#### א (Alef)

### The Prophet Speaks

[1] Alas! Gold has lost its luster;<br>
pure gold loses value.<br>
Jewels are scattered<br>
on every street corner.<br>
#### ב (Bet)

[2] The precious sons of Zion<br>
were worth their weight in gold—<br>
Alas!—but now they are treated like broken clay pots,<br>
made by a potter.<br>
#### ג (Gimel)

[3] Even the jackals nurse their young<br>
at their breast,<br>
but my people are cruel,<br>
like ostriches in the wilderness.<br>
#### ד (Dalet)

[4] The infant’s tongue sticks<br>
to the roof of its mouth due to thirst;<br>
little children beg for bread,<br>
but no one gives them even a morsel.<br>
#### ה (He)

[5] Those who once feasted on delicacies<br>
are now starving to death in the streets.<br>
Those who grew up wearing expensive clothes<br>
are now dying amid garbage.<br>
#### ו (Vav)

[6] The punishment of my people<br>
exceeds that of Sodom,<br>
which was overthrown in a moment<br>
with no one to help her.<br>
#### ז (Zayin)

[7] Our consecrated ones were brighter than snow,<br>
whiter than milk;<br>
their bodies more ruddy than corals,<br>
their hair like lapis lazuli.<br>
#### ח (Khet)

[8] Now their appearance is darker than soot;<br>
they are not recognized in the streets.<br>
Their skin has shriveled on their bones;<br>
it is dried up, like tree bark.<br>
#### ט (Tet)

[9] Those who die by the sword are better off<br>
than those who die of hunger,<br>
those who waste away,<br>
struck down from lack of food.<br>
#### י (Yod)

[10] The hands of tenderhearted women<br>
cooked their own children,<br>
who became their food,<br>
when my people were destroyed.<br>
#### כ (Kaf)

[11] The **Lord** fully vented his wrath;<br>
he poured out his fierce anger.<br>
He started a fire in Zion;<br>
it consumed her foundations.<br>
#### ל (Lamed)

[12] Neither the kings of the earth<br>
nor the people of the lands ever thought<br>
that enemy or foe could enter<br>
the gates of Jerusalem.<br>
#### מ (Mem)

[13] But it happened due to the sins of her prophets<br>
and the iniquities of her priests,<br>
who poured out in her midst<br>
the blood of the righteous.<br>
#### נ (Nun)

[14] They wander blindly through the streets,<br>
defiled by the blood they shed,<br>
while no one dares<br>
to touch their garments.<br>
#### ס (Samek)

[15] People cry to them, “Turn away! You are unclean!<br>
Turn away! Turn away! Don’t touch us!”<br>
So they have fled and wander about;<br>
but the nations say, “They may not stay here any longer.”<br>
#### פ (Pe)

[16] The **Lord** himself has scattered them;<br>
he no longer watches over them.<br>
They did not honor the priests;<br>
they did not show favor to the elders.<br>
#### ע (Ayin)

### The People of Jerusalem Lament

[17] Our eyes continually failed us<br>
as we looked in vain for help.<br>
From our watchtowers we watched<br>
for a nation that could not rescue us.<br>
#### צ (Tsade)

[18] Our enemies hunted us down at every step<br>
so that we could not walk about in our streets.<br>
Our end drew near, our days were numbered,<br>
for our end had come!<br>
#### ק (Qof)

[19] Those who pursued us were swifter<br>
than eagles in the sky.<br>
They chased us over the mountains;<br>
they ambushed us in the wilderness.<br>
#### ר (Resh)

[20] Our very life breath—the **Lord**’s anointed king —<br>
was caught in their traps,<br>
of whom we thought,<br>
“Under his protection we will survive among the nations.”<br>
#### ש (Sin/Shin)

### The Prophet Speaks

[21] Rejoice and be glad for now, O people of Edom,<br>
who reside in the land of Uz.<br>
But the cup of judgment will pass to you also;<br>
you will get drunk and take off your clothes.<br>
#### ת (Tav)

[22] O people of Zion, your punishment will come to an end;<br>
he will not prolong your exile.<br>
But, O people of Edom, he will punish your sin<br>
and reveal your offenses!<br>
## Chapter 5

### The People of Jerusalem Pray

[1] O **Lord**, reflect on what has happened to us;<br>
consider and look at our disgrace.<br>
[2] Our inheritance is turned over to strangers;<br>
foreigners now occupy our homes.<br>
[3] We have become fatherless orphans;<br>
our mothers have become widows.<br>
[4] We must pay money for our own water;<br>
we must buy our own wood at a steep price.<br>
[5] We are pursued—they are breathing down our necks;<br>
we are weary and have no rest.<br>
[6] We have submitted to Egypt and Assyria<br>
in order to buy food to eat.<br>
[7] Our forefathers sinned and are dead,<br>
but we suffer their punishment.<br>
[8] Slaves rule over us;<br>
there is no one to rescue us from their power.<br>
[9] At the risk of our lives we get our food<br>
because robbers lurk in the wilderness.<br>
[10] Our skin is as hot as an oven<br>
due to a fever from hunger.<br>
[11] They raped women in Zion,<br>
virgins in the towns of Judah.<br>
[12] Princes were hung by their hands;<br>
elders were mistreated.<br>
[13] The young men perform menial labor;<br>
boys stagger from their labor.<br>
[14] The elders are gone from the city gate;<br>
the young men have stopped playing their music.<br>
[15] Our hearts no longer have any joy;<br>
our dancing is turned to mourning.<br>
[16] The crown has fallen from our head;<br>
woe to us, for we have sinned!<br>
[17] Because of this, our hearts are sick;<br>
because of these things, we can hardly see through our tears.<br>
[18] For wild animals are prowling over Mount Zion,<br>
which lies desolate.<br>
[19] But you, O **Lord**, reign forever;<br>
your throne endures from generation to generation.<br>
[20] Why do you keep on forgetting us?<br>
Why do you forsake us so long?<br>
[21] Bring us back to yourself, O **Lord**, so that we may return to you;<br>
renew our life as in days before,<br>
[22] unless you have utterly rejected us<br>
and are angry with us beyond measure.<br>
