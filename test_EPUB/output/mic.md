# Micah

## Chapter 1

### Introduction

[1] This is the **Lord**'s message that came to Micah of Moresheth during the time of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.

### The Judge is Coming

[2] Listen, all you nations!<br>
Pay attention, all inhabitants of earth!<br>
The Sovereign **Lord** will act as a witness against you;<br>
the Lord will accuse you from his majestic palace.<br>
[3] Look, the **Lord** is coming out of his dwelling place!<br>
He will descend and march on the earth’s mountaintops!<br>
[4] The mountains will crumble beneath him,<br>
and the valleys will split apart<br>
like wax before a fire,<br>
like water dumped down a steep slope.<br>

[5] All this is because of Jacob’s rebellion<br>
and the sins of the nation of Israel.<br>
And just what is Jacob’s rebellion?<br>
Isn’t it Samaria’s doings?<br>
And what is Judah’s sin?<br>
Isn’t it Jerusalem’s doings?<br>

[6] “I will turn Samaria into a heap of ruins in an open field,<br>
into a place for planting vineyards.<br>
I will dump the rubble of her walls down into the valley<br>
and lay bare her foundations.<br>
[7] All her carved idols will be smashed to pieces;<br>
all her metal cult statues will be destroyed by fire.<br>
I will make a waste heap of all her images.<br>
Since she gathered the metal as a prostitute collects her wages,<br>
the idols will become a prostitute’s wages again.”<br>
[8] For this reason I will mourn and wail;<br>
I will walk around barefoot and without my outer garments.<br>
I will howl like a wild dog,<br>
and screech like an owl.<br>
[9] For Samaria’s disease is incurable.<br>
It has infected Judah;<br>
it has spread to the leadership of my people<br>
and even to Jerusalem!<br>
[10] Don’t spread the news in Gath.<br>
Don’t shed even a single tear.<br>
In Beth Leaphrah roll about in mourning in the dust!<br>
[11] Residents of Shaphir, pass by in nakedness and humiliation!<br>
The residents of Zaanan have not escaped.<br>
Beth Ezel mourns,<br>
“He takes from you what he desires.”<br>
[12] Indeed, the residents of Maroth hope for something good to happen,<br>
though the **Lord** has sent disaster against the city of Jerusalem.<br>
[13] Residents of Lachish, hitch the horses to the chariots!<br>
You influenced Daughter Zion to sin,<br>
for Israel’s rebellious deeds can be traced back to you!<br>
[14] Therefore you will have to say farewell to Moresheth Gath.<br>
The residents of Achzib will be as disappointing<br>
as a dried up well to the kings of Israel.<br>
[15] Residents of Mareshah, a conqueror will attack you;<br>
the leaders of Israel shall flee to Adullam.<br>
[16] Shave your heads bald as you mourn for the children you love;<br>
shave your foreheads as bald as an eagle,<br>
for they are taken from you into exile.<br>
## Chapter 2

### Land Robbers Will Lose Their Land

[1] Beware wicked schemers,<br>
those who devise calamity as they lie in bed.<br>
As soon as morning dawns they carry out their plans,<br>
because they have the power to do so.<br>
[2] They confiscate the fields they desire<br>
and seize the houses they want.<br>
They defraud people of their homes<br>
and deprive people of the land they have inherited.<br>

[3] Therefore the **Lord** says this:

“Look, I am devising disaster for this nation!<br>
It will be like a yoke from which you cannot free your neck.<br>
You will no longer walk proudly,<br>
for it will be a time of catastrophe.<br>
[4] In that day people will sing this taunt song to you—<br>
they will mock you with this lament:<br>
‘We are completely destroyed;<br>
they sell off the property of my people.<br>
How they remove it from me!<br>
They assign our fields to the conqueror.’”<br>
[5] Therefore no one will assign you land in the **Lord**’s community.<br>

[6] “Don’t preach with such impassioned rhetoric,” they say excitedly.<br>
“These prophets should not preach of such things;<br>
we will not be overtaken by humiliation.”<br>
[7] Does the family of Jacob say,<br>
“The **Lord**’s patience can’t be exhausted—<br>
he would never do such things”?<br>
To be sure, my commands bring a reward<br>
for those who obey them,<br>
[8] but you rise up as an enemy against my people.<br>
You steal a robe from a friend,<br>
from those who pass by peacefully as if returning from a war.<br>
[9] You wrongly evict widows among my people from their cherished homes.<br>
You defraud their children of their prized inheritance.<br>
[10] But you are the ones who will be forced to leave!<br>
For this land is not secure;<br>
sin will thoroughly destroy it!<br>
[11] If a lying windbag should come and say,<br>
‘I’ll promise you blessings of wine and beer,’<br>
he would be just the right preacher for these people!<br>

### The Lord Will Restore His People

[12] “I will certainly gather all of you, O Jacob,<br>
I will certainly assemble those Israelites who remain.<br>
I will bring them together like sheep in a fold,<br>
like a flock in the middle of a pasture;<br>
they will be so numerous that they will make a lot of noise.<br>
[13] The one who can break through barriers will lead them out;<br>
they will break out, pass through the gate, and leave.<br>
Their king will advance before them;<br>
the **Lord** himself will lead them.”<br>
## Chapter 3

### God Will Judge Judah’s Sinful Leaders

[1] I said,<br>
“Listen, you leaders of Jacob,<br>
you rulers of the nation of Israel!<br>
You ought to know what is just,<br>
[2] yet you hate what is good<br>
and love what is evil.<br>
You flay my people’s skin<br>
and rip the flesh from their bones.<br>
[3] You devour my people’s flesh,<br>
strip off their skin,<br>
and crush their bones.<br>
You chop them up like flesh in a pot —<br>
like meat in a kettle.<br>
[4] Someday these sinful leaders will cry to the **Lord** for help,<br>
but he will not answer them.<br>
He will hide his face from them at that time,<br>
because they have done such wicked deeds.”<br>

[5] This is what the **Lord** has said about the prophets who mislead my people,

“If someone gives them enough to eat,<br>
they offer an oracle of peace.<br>
But if someone does not give them food,<br>
they are ready to declare war on him.<br>
[6] Therefore night will fall, and you will receive no visions;<br>
it will grow dark, and you will no longer be able to read the omens.<br>
The sun will set on these prophets,<br>
and the daylight will turn to darkness over their heads.<br>
[7] The prophets will be ashamed;<br>
the omen readers will be humiliated.<br>
All of them will cover their mouths,<br>
for they will receive no divine oracles.”<br>

[8] But I am full of the courage that the **Lord**’s Spirit gives<br>
and have a strong commitment to justice.<br>
This enables me to confront Jacob with its rebellion<br>
and Israel with its sin.<br>
[9] Listen to this, you leaders of the family of Jacob,<br>
you rulers of the nation of Israel!<br>
You hate justice<br>
and pervert all that is right.<br>
[10] You build Zion through bloody crimes,<br>
Jerusalem through unjust violence.<br>
[11] Her leaders take bribes when they decide legal cases,<br>
her priests proclaim rulings for profit,<br>
and her prophets read omens for pay.<br>
Yet they claim to trust the **Lord** and say,<br>
“The **Lord** is among us.<br>
Disaster will not overtake us!”<br>
[12] Therefore, because of you, Zion will be plowed up like a field,<br>
Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins,<br>
and the Temple Mount will become a hill overgrown with brush!<br>
## Chapter 4

### Better Days Ahead for Jerusalem

[1] And in future days the **Lord**’s Temple Mount will be the most important mountain of all;<br>
it will be more prominent than other hills.<br>
People will stream to it.<br>
[2] Many nations will come, saying,<br>
“Come on! Let’s go up to the **Lord**’s mountain,<br>
to the temple of Jacob’s God,<br>
so he can teach us his ways<br>
and we can live by his laws.”<br>
For instruction will proceed from Zion,<br>
the **Lord**’s message from Jerusalem.<br>
[3] He will arbitrate between many peoples<br>
and settle disputes between many distant nations.<br>
They will beat their swords into plowshares,<br>
and their spears into pruning hooks.<br>
Nations will not use weapons against other nations,<br>
and they will no longer train for war.<br>
[4] Each will sit under his own grapevine<br>
or under his own fig tree without any fear.<br>
The **Lord** of Heaven’s Armies has decreed it.<br>
[5] Though all the nations follow their respective gods,<br>
we will follow the **Lord** our God forever.<br>

### Restoration Will Follow Crisis

[6] “In that day,” says the **Lord**, “I will gather the lame<br>
and assemble the outcasts whom I injured.<br>
[7] I will transform the lame into the nucleus of a new nation,<br>
and those far off into a mighty nation.<br>
The **Lord** will reign over them on Mount Zion,<br>
from that day forward and forevermore.<br>
[8] As for you, watchtower for the flock,<br>
fortress of Daughter Zion —<br>
your former dominion will be restored,<br>
the sovereignty that belongs to Daughter Jerusalem.”<br>
[9] Jerusalem, why are you now shouting so loudly?<br>
Has your king disappeared?<br>
Has your wise leader been destroyed?<br>
Is this why pain grips you as if you were a woman in labor?<br>
[10] Twist and strain, Daughter Zion, as if you were in labor!<br>
For you will leave the city<br>
and live in the open field.<br>
You will go to Babylon,<br>
but there you will be rescued.<br>
There the **Lord** will deliver you<br>
from the power of your enemies.<br>
[11] Many nations have now assembled against you.<br>
They say, “Jerusalem must be desecrated,<br>
so we can gloat over Zion!”<br>
[12] But they do not know what the **Lord** is planning;<br>
they do not understand his strategy.<br>
He has gathered them like stalks of grain to be threshed at the threshing floor.<br>
[13] “Get up and thresh, Daughter Zion!<br>
For I will give you iron horns;<br>
I will give you bronze hooves,<br>
and you will crush many nations.”<br>
You will devote to the **Lord** the spoils you take from them<br>
and dedicate their wealth to the sovereign Ruler of the whole earth.<br>
## Chapter 5

[1] (4:14) But now slash yourself, daughter surrounded by soldiers!<br>
We are besieged!<br>
With a scepter they strike Israel’s ruler<br>
on the side of his face.<br>

### A King Will Come and a Remnant Will Prosper

[2] (5:1) As for you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,<br>
seemingly insignificant among the clans of Judah—<br>
from you a king will emerge who will rule over Israel on my behalf,<br>
one whose origins are in the distant past.<br>
[3] So the **Lord** will hand the people of Israel over to their enemies<br>
until the time when the woman in labor gives birth.<br>
Then the rest of the king’s countrymen will return<br>
to be reunited with the people of Israel.<br>
[4] He will assume his post and shepherd the people by the **Lord**’s strength,<br>
by the sovereign authority of the **Lord** his God.<br>
They will live securely, for at that time he will be honored<br>
even in the distant regions of the earth.<br>
[5] He will give us peace.<br>
Should the Assyrians try to invade our land<br>
and attempt to set foot in our fortresses,<br>
we will send against them seven shepherd-rulers,<br>
make that eight commanders.<br>
[6] They will rule the land of Assyria with the sword,<br>
the land of Nimrod with a drawn sword.<br>
Our king will rescue us from the Assyrians<br>
should they attempt to invade our land<br>
and try to set foot in our territory.<br>
[7] Those survivors from Jacob will live<br>
in the midst of many nations.<br>
They will be like the dew the **Lord** sends,<br>
like the rain on the grass,<br>
that does not hope for men to come<br>
or wait around for humans to arrive.<br>
[8] Those survivors from Jacob will live among the nations,<br>
in the midst of many peoples.<br>
They will be like a lion among the animals of the forest,<br>
like a young lion among the flocks of sheep,<br>
which attacks when it passes through.<br>
It rips its prey and there is no one to stop it.<br>
[9] Lift your hand triumphantly against your adversaries;<br>
may all your enemies be destroyed!<br>

### The Lord Will Purify His People

[10] “In that day,” says the **Lord**,<br>
“I will destroy your horses from your midst<br>
and smash your chariots.<br>
[11] I will destroy the cities of your land<br>
and tear down all your fortresses.<br>
[12] I will remove the sorcery that you practice,<br>
and you will no longer have omen readers living among you.<br>
[13] I will remove your idols and sacred pillars from your midst;<br>
you will no longer worship what your own hands made.<br>
[14] I will uproot your images of Asherah from your midst<br>
and destroy your idols.<br>
[15] With furious anger I will carry out vengeance<br>
on the nations that do not obey me.”<br>
## Chapter 6

### The Lord Demands Justice, not Ritual

[1] Listen to what the **Lord** says:

“Get up! Defend yourself before the mountains.<br>
Present your case before the hills.”<br>
[2] Hear the **Lord**’s accusation, you mountains,<br>
you enduring foundations of the earth.<br>
For the **Lord** has a case against his people;<br>
he has a dispute with Israel!<br>
[3] “My people, how have I wronged you?<br>
How have I wearied you? Answer me!<br>
[4] In fact, I brought you up from the land of Egypt;<br>
I delivered you from that place of slavery.<br>
I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to lead you.<br>
[5] My people, recall how King Balak of Moab planned to harm you,<br>
how Balaam son of Beor responded to him.<br>
Recall how you journeyed from Shittim to Gilgal,<br>
so you might acknowledge that the **Lord** has treated you fairly.”<br>

[6] With what should I enter the **Lord**’s presence?<br>
With what should I bow before the sovereign God?<br>
Should I enter his presence with burnt offerings,<br>
with year-old calves?<br>
[7] Will the **Lord** accept a thousand rams<br>
or ten thousand streams of olive oil?<br>
Should I give him my firstborn child as payment for my rebellion,<br>
my offspring—my own flesh and blood—for my sin?<br>
[8] He has told you, O man, what is good,<br>
and what the **Lord** really wants from you:<br>
He wants you to carry out justice, to love faithfulness,<br>
and to live obediently before your God.<br>

[9] Listen! The **Lord** is calling to the city!<br>
It is wise to respect your authority, O **Lord**.<br>
Listen, O nation, and those assembled in the city!<br>
[10] “I will not overlook, O sinful house, the dishonest gain you have hoarded away<br>
or the smaller-than-standard measure I hate so much.<br>
[11] I do not condone the use of rigged scales,<br>
or a bag of deceptive weights.<br>
[12] The city’s wealthy people readily resort to violence;<br>
her inhabitants tell lies;<br>
their tongues speak deceptive words.<br>
[13] I will strike you brutally<br>
and destroy you because of your sin.<br>
[14] You will eat, but not be satisfied.<br>
Even if you have the strength to overtake some prey,<br>
you will not be able to carry it away;<br>
if you do happen to carry away something,<br>
I will deliver it over to the sword.<br>
[15] You will plant crops, but will not harvest them;<br>
you will squeeze oil from the olives, but you will have no oil to rub on your bodies;<br>
you will squeeze juice from the grapes, but you will have no wine to drink.<br>
[16] You follow Omri’s edicts<br>
and all the practices of Ahab’s dynasty;<br>
you follow their policies.<br>
Therefore I will make you an appalling sight;<br>
the city’s inhabitants will be taunted derisively,<br>
and nations will mock all of you.”<br>
## Chapter 7

### Micah Laments Judah’s Sin

[1] Woe is me!<br>
For I am like those gathering fruit<br>
and those harvesting grapes,<br>
when there is no grape cluster to eat<br>
and no fresh figs that my stomach craves.<br>
[2] Faithful men have disappeared from the land;<br>
there are no godly men left.<br>
They all wait in ambush to shed blood;<br>
they hunt their own brother with a net.<br>
[3] They are experts at doing evil;<br>
government officials and judges take bribes,<br>
prominent men announce what they wish,<br>
and then they plan it out.<br>
[4] The best of them is like a thorn;<br>
their godly are like a thorn bush.<br>
Woe to your watchmen;<br>
your appointed punishment is on the way.<br>
The time of their confusion is now.<br>
[5] Do not rely on a friend;<br>
do not trust a companion!<br>
Even with the one who lies in your arms,<br>
do not share secrets!<br>
[6] For a son thinks his father is a fool,<br>
a daughter challenges her mother,<br>
and a daughter-in-law her mother-in-law;<br>
a man’s enemies are his own family.<br>
[7] But I will keep watching for the **Lord**;<br>
I will wait for the God who delivers me.<br>
My God will listen to me.<br>

### Jerusalem Will Be Vindicated

[8] My enemies, do not gloat over me!<br>
Though I have fallen, I will get up.<br>
Though I sit in darkness, the **Lord** will be my light.<br>
[9] I must endure the **Lord**’s fury,<br>
for I have sinned against him.<br>
But then he will defend my cause<br>
and accomplish justice on my behalf.<br>
He will lead me out into the light;<br>
I will witness his deliverance.<br>
[10] When my enemies see this, they will be covered with shame.<br>
They say to me, “Where is the **Lord** your God?”<br>
I will gloat over them;<br>
then they will be trampled down<br>
like mud in the streets.<br>
[11] It will be a day for rebuilding your walls;<br>
in that day your boundary will be extended.<br>

### A Closing Prayer

[12] In that day people will come to you<br>
from Assyria as far as Egypt,<br>
from Egypt as far as the Euphrates River,<br>
from the seacoasts and the mountains.<br>
[13] The earth will become desolate<br>
because of what its inhabitants have done.<br>
[14] Shepherd your people with your rod,<br>
the flock that belongs to you,<br>
the one that lives alone in a thicket,<br>
in the midst of a pastureland.<br>
Allow them to graze in Bashan and Gilead,<br>
as they did in the old days.<br>
[15] “As in the days when you departed from the land of Egypt,<br>
I will show you miraculous deeds.”<br>
[16] Nations will see this and be disappointed by all their strength;<br>
they will put their hands over their mouths<br>
and act as if they were deaf.<br>
[17] They will lick the dust like a snake,<br>
like serpents crawling on the ground.<br>
They will come trembling from their strongholds<br>
to the **Lord** our God;<br>
they will be terrified of you.<br>
[18] Who is a God like you?<br>
Who forgives sin<br>
and pardons the rebellion<br>
of those who remain among his people?<br>
Who does not stay angry forever,<br>
but delights in showing loyal love?<br>
[19] Who will once again have mercy on us?<br>
Who will conquer our evil deeds?<br>
Who will hurl all our sins into the depths of the sea?<br>
[20] You will be loyal to Jacob<br>
and extend your loyal love to Abraham,<br>
which you promised on oath to our ancestors in ancient times.<br>
