# Nahum

## Chapter 1

### Introduction

[1] This is an oracle about Nineveh; the book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite:

### God Takes Vengeance against His Enemies

[2] The **Lord** is a zealous and avenging God;<br>
the **Lord** is avenging and very angry.<br>
The **Lord** takes vengeance against his foes;<br>
he sustains his rage against his enemies.<br>
[3] The **Lord** is slow to anger but great in power;<br>
the **Lord** will certainly not allow the wicked to go unpunished.<br>
### The Divine Warrior Destroys His Enemies but Protects His People

He marches out in the whirlwind and the raging storm;<br>
dark storm clouds billow like dust under his feet.<br>
[4] He shouts a battle cry against the sea and makes it dry up;<br>
he makes all the rivers run dry.<br>
Bashan and Carmel wither;<br>
the blossom of Lebanon withers.<br>
[5] The mountains tremble before him,<br>
the hills convulse;<br>
the earth is laid waste before him,<br>
the world and all its inhabitants are laid waste.<br>
[6] No one can withstand his indignation!<br>
No one can resist his fierce anger!<br>
His wrath is poured out like volcanic fire,<br>
boulders are broken up as he approaches.<br>
[7] The **Lord** is good —<br>
indeed, he is a fortress in time of distress,<br>
and he protects those who seek refuge in him.<br>
[8] But with an overwhelming flood<br>
he will make a complete end of Nineveh;<br>
he will drive his enemies into darkness.<br>
### Denunciation and Destruction of Nineveh

[9] Whatever you plot against the **Lord**, he will completely destroy!<br>
Distress will not arise a second time.<br>
[10] Surely they will be totally consumed<br>
like entangled thorn bushes,<br>
like the drink of drunkards,<br>
like very dry stubble.<br>
[11] From you, O Nineveh, one has marched forth who plots evil against the **Lord**,<br>
a wicked military strategist.<br>
### Oracle of Deliverance to Judah

[12] This is what the **Lord** says:

“Even though they are powerful —<br>
and what is more, even though their army is numerous —<br>
nevertheless, they will be destroyed and trickle away!<br>
Although I afflicted you,<br>
I will afflict you no more.<br>
[13] And now, I will break Assyria’s yoke bar from your neck;<br>
I will tear apart the shackles that are on you.”<br>
### Oracle of Judgment against the King of Nineveh

[14] The **Lord** has issued a decree against you:<br>
“Your dynasty will come to an end.<br>
I will destroy the idols and images in the temples of your gods.<br>
I will desecrate your grave, because you are accursed!”<br>
### Proclamation of the Deliverance of Judah

[15] (2:1) Look! A herald is running on the mountains!<br>
A messenger is proclaiming deliverance:<br>
“Celebrate your sacred festivals, O Judah!<br>
Fulfill your sacred vows to praise God!<br>
For never again will the wicked Assyrians invade you;<br>
they have been completely destroyed.”<br>
## Chapter 2

### Proclamation of the Destruction of Nineveh

[1] (2:2) An enemy who will scatter you, Nineveh, has advanced against you!<br>
Guard the rampart!<br>
Watch the road!<br>
Prepare yourselves for battle!<br>
Muster your mighty strength!<br>
[2] For the **Lord** is about to restore the majesty of Jacob,<br>
as well as the majesty of Israel,<br>
though their enemies have plundered them<br>
and have destroyed their fields.<br>
### Prophetic Vision of the Fall of Nineveh

[3] The shields of his warriors are dyed red;<br>
the mighty soldiers are dressed in scarlet garments.<br>
The chariots are in flashing metal fittings<br>
on the day of battle;<br>
the soldiers brandish their spears.<br>
[4] The chariots race madly through the streets,<br>
they rush back and forth in the broad plazas;<br>
they look like lightning bolts,<br>
they dash here and there like flashes of lightning.<br>
[5] The commander orders his officers;<br>
they stumble as they advance;<br>
they rush to the city wall,<br>
and they set up the covered siege tower.<br>
[6] The sluice gates are opened;<br>
the royal palace is deluged and dissolves.<br>
[7] Nineveh is taken into exile and is led away;<br>
her slave girls moan like doves while they beat their breasts.<br>
[8] Nineveh was like a pool of water throughout her days,<br>
but now her people are running away;<br>
she cries out: “Stop! Stop!”—<br>
but no one turns back.<br>
[9] Her conquerors cry out:<br>
“Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold!”<br>
There is no end to the treasure;<br>
riches of every kind of precious thing.<br>
[10] Destruction, devastation, and desolation!<br>
Hearts faint, knees tremble;<br>
every stomach churns, all their faces have turned pale!<br>
### Taunt against the Once-Mighty Lion

[11] Where now is the den of the lions<br>
and the feeding place of the young lions,<br>
where the lion, lioness, and lion cub once prowled<br>
and no one disturbed them?<br>
[12] The lion tore apart as much prey as his cubs needed<br>
and strangled prey for his lionesses;<br>
he filled his lairs with prey<br>
and his dens with torn flesh.<br>

### Battle Cry of the Divine Warrior

[13] “I am against you!” declares the **Lord** of Heaven’s Armies:<br>
“I will burn your chariots with fire;<br>
the sword will devour your young lions.<br>
You will no longer prey upon the land;<br>
the voices of your messengers will no longer be heard.”<br>
## Chapter 3

### Reason for Judgment: Sins of Nineveh

[1] Woe to the city guilty of bloodshed!<br>
She is full of lies;<br>
she is filled with plunder;<br>
she has hoarded her spoil!<br>
### Portrayal of the Destruction of Nineveh

[2] The chariot drivers will crack their whips;<br>
the chariot wheels will shake the ground.<br>
The chariot horses will gallop;<br>
the war chariots will bolt forward!<br>
[3] The charioteers will charge ahead;<br>
their swords will flash<br>
and their spears will glimmer!<br>
There will be many people slain;<br>
there will be piles of the dead<br>
and countless casualties —<br>
so many that people will stumble over the corpses.<br>
### Taunt against the Harlot City

[4] Because you have acted like a wanton prostitute —<br>
a seductive mistress who practices sorcery,<br>
who enslaves nations by her harlotry,<br>
and entices peoples by her sorcery —<br>
[5] “I am against you,” declares the **Lord** of Heaven’s Armies.<br>
“I will strip off your clothes!<br>
I will show your nakedness to the nations<br>
and your shame to the kingdoms.<br>
[6] I will pelt you with filth;<br>
I will treat you with contempt;<br>
I will make you a public spectacle.<br>
[7] Everyone who sees you will turn away from you in disgust;<br>
they will say, ‘Nineveh has been devastated!<br>
Who will lament for her?’<br>
There will be no one to comfort you!”<br>
### Nineveh Will Suffer the Same Fate as Thebes

[8] You are no more secure than Thebes —<br>
she was located on the banks of the Nile;<br>
the waters surrounded her—<br>
her rampart was the sea,<br>
the water was her wall.<br>
[9] Cush and Egypt had limitless strength;<br>
Put and the Libyans were among her allies.<br>
[10] Yet she went into captivity as an exile;<br>
even her infants were smashed to pieces at the head of every street.<br>
They cast lots for her nobility;<br>
all her dignitaries were bound with chains.<br>
[11] You too will act like drunkards;<br>
you will go into hiding;<br>
you too will seek refuge from the enemy.<br>
### The Assyrian Defenses Will Fail

[12] All your fortifications will be like fig trees with first-ripe fruit:<br>
If they are shaken, their figs will fall into the mouth of the eater.<br>
[13] Your warriors will be like women in your midst;<br>
the gates of your land will be wide open to your enemies;<br>
fire will consume the bars of your gates.<br>
[14] Draw yourselves water for a siege!<br>
Strengthen your fortifications!<br>
Trample the mud and tread the clay!<br>
Make mud bricks to strengthen your walls!<br>
[15] There the fire will consume you;<br>
the sword will cut you down;<br>
it will devour you like the young locust would.<br>
### The Assyrian Defenders Will Flee

Multiply yourself like the young locust;<br>
multiply yourself like the flying locust!<br>
[16] Increase your merchants more than the stars of heaven!<br>
They are like the young locust that sheds its skin and flies away.<br>
[17] Your courtiers are like locusts,<br>
your officials are like a swarm of locusts!<br>
They encamp in the walls on a cold day,<br>
yet when the sun rises, they fly away,<br>
and no one knows where they are.<br>
### Concluding Dirge

[18] Your shepherds are sleeping, O king of Assyria.<br>
Your officers are slumbering!<br>
Your people are scattered like sheep on the mountains,<br>
and there is no one to regather them.<br>
[19] Your destruction is like an incurable wound;<br>
your demise is like a fatal injury.<br>
All who hear what has happened to you will clap their hands for joy,<br>
for no one ever escaped your endless cruelty!<br>
