# Obadiah

## Chapter 1

### God’s Judgment on Edom

[1] The vision that Obadiah saw.<br>
The Sovereign **Lord** says this concerning Edom:<br>

### Edom’s Approaching Destruction

We have heard a report from the **Lord**.<br>
An envoy was sent among the nations, saying,<br>
“Arise! Let us make war against Edom!”<br>
[2] The **Lord** says, “Look! I will make you a weak nation;<br>
you will be greatly despised!<br>
[3] Your presumptuous heart has deceived you—<br>
you who reside in the safety of the rocky cliffs,<br>
whose home is high in the mountains.<br>
You think to yourself,<br>
‘No one can bring me down to the ground!’<br>
[4] Even if you were to soar high like an eagle,<br>
even if you were to make your nest among the stars,<br>
I can bring you down even from there!” says the **Lord**.<br>

[5] “If thieves came to rob you during the night,<br>
they would steal only as much as they wanted.<br>
If grape pickers came to harvest your vineyards,<br>
they would leave some behind for the poor.<br>
But you will be totally destroyed!<br>
[6] How the people of Esau will be thoroughly plundered!<br>
Their hidden valuables will be ransacked!<br>
[7] All your allies will force you from your homeland!<br>
Your treaty partners will deceive you and overpower you.<br>
Your trusted friends will set an ambush for you<br>
that will take you by surprise!<br>

[8] At that time,” the **Lord** says,<br>
“I will destroy the wise sages of Edom,<br>
the advisers from Esau’s mountain.<br>
[9] Your warriors will be shattered, O Teman,<br>
so that everyone will be destroyed from Esau’s mountain!<br>

### Edom’s Treachery Against Judah

[10] “Because you violently slaughtered your relatives, the people of Jacob,<br>
shame will cover you, and you will be destroyed forever.<br>
[11] You stood aloof while strangers took his army captive,<br>
and foreigners advanced to his gates.<br>
When they cast lots over Jerusalem,<br>
you behaved as though you were in league with them.<br>
[12] You should not have gloated when your relatives suffered calamity.<br>
You should not have rejoiced over the people of Judah when they were destroyed.<br>
You should not have boasted when they suffered adversity.<br>
[13] You should not have entered the city of my people when they experienced distress.<br>
You should not have joined in gloating over their misfortune when they suffered distress.<br>
You should not have looted their wealth when they endured distress.<br>
[14] You should not have stood at the fork in the road to slaughter those trying to escape.<br>
You should not have captured their refugees when they suffered adversity.<br>

### The Coming Day of the Lord

[15] “For the day of the **Lord** is approaching for all the nations!<br>
Just as you have done, so it will be done to you.<br>
You will get exactly what your deeds deserve.<br>
[16] For just as you have drunk on my holy mountain,<br>
so all the nations will drink continually.<br>
They will drink, and they will gulp down;<br>
they will be as though they had never been.<br>
[17] But on Mount Zion there will be a remnant of those who escape,<br>
and it will be a holy place once again.<br>
The descendants of Jacob will conquer<br>
those who had conquered them.<br>
[18] The descendants of Jacob will be a fire,<br>
and the descendants of Joseph a flame.<br>
The descendants of Esau will be like stubble.<br>
They will burn them up and devour them.<br>
There will not be a single survivor of the descendants of Esau!”<br>
Indeed, the **Lord** has spoken it.<br>
[19] The people of the Negev will take possession of Esau’s mountain,<br>
and the people of the foothills will take<br>
possession of the land of the Philistines.<br>
They will also take possession of the territory of Ephraim and the territory of Samaria,<br>
and the people of Benjamin will take possession of Gilead.<br>
[20] The exiles of this fortress of the people of Israel<br>
will take possession of what belongs to<br>
the people of Canaan, as far as Zarephath,<br>
and the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad<br>
will take possession of the towns of the Negev.<br>
[21] Those who have been delivered will go up on Mount Zion<br>
in order to rule over Esau’s mountain.<br>
Then the **Lord** will reign as King!<br>
