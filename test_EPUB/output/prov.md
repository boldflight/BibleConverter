# Proverbs

## Chapter 1

### Introduction to the Book

[1] The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:<br>
[2] To learn wisdom and moral instruction,<br>
to discern wise counsel.<br>
[3] To receive moral instruction in skillful living,<br>
with righteousness, justice, and equity.<br>
[4] To impart shrewdness to the morally naive,<br>
a discerning plan to the young person.<br>
[5] (Let the wise also hear and gain instruction,<br>
and let the discerning acquire guidance!)<br>
[6] To discern the meaning of a proverb and a parable,<br>
the sayings of the wise and their riddles.<br>

### Introduction to the Theme of the Book

[7] Fearing the **Lord** is the beginning of discernment,<br>
but fools have despised wisdom and moral instruction.<br>
[8] Listen, my child, to the instruction from your father,<br>
and do not forsake the teaching from your mother.<br>
[9] For they will be like an elegant garland on your head,<br>
and like pendants around your neck.<br>

### Admonition to Avoid Easy but Unjust Riches

[10] My child, if sinners try to entice you,<br>
do not consent!<br>
[11] If they say, “Come with us!<br>
We will lie in wait to shed blood;<br>
we will ambush an innocent person capriciously.<br>
[12] We will swallow them alive like Sheol,<br>
those full of vigor like those going down to the Pit.<br>
[13] We will seize all kinds of precious wealth;<br>
we will fill our houses with plunder.<br>
[14] Join with us!<br>
We will all share equally in what we steal.”<br>
[15] My child, do not go down their way,<br>
withhold yourself from their path;<br>
[16] for they are eager to inflict harm,<br>
and they hasten to shed blood.<br>
[17] Surely it is futile to spread a net<br>
in plain sight of any bird,<br>
[18] but these men lie in wait for their own blood,<br>
they ambush their own lives!<br>
[19] Such are the ways of all who gain profit unjustly;<br>
it takes away the life of those who obtain it!<br>

### Warning Against Disregarding Wisdom

[20] Wisdom calls out in the street,<br>
she shouts loudly in the plazas;<br>
[21] at the head of the noisy streets she calls,<br>
in the entrances of the gates in the city she utters her words:<br>
[22] “How long will you simpletons love naiveté?<br>
How long have mockers delighted in mockery?<br>
And how long will fools hate knowledge?<br>
[23] You should respond to my rebuke.<br>
Then I would pour out my thoughts to you;<br>
I would make my words known to you.<br>
[24] However, because I called but you refused to listen,<br>
because I stretched out my hand but no one was paying attention,<br>
[25] and you neglected all my advice,<br>
and did not comply with my rebuke,<br>
[26] so I myself will laugh when disaster strikes you,<br>
I will mock when what you dread comes,<br>
[27] when what you dread comes like a whirlwind,<br>
and disaster strikes you like a devastating storm,<br>
when distressing trouble comes on you.<br>
[28] Then they will call to me, but I will not answer;<br>
they will diligently seek me, but they will not find me.<br>
[29] Because they hated moral knowledge,<br>
and did not choose to fear the **Lord**,<br>
[30] they did not comply with my advice,<br>
they spurned all my rebuke.<br>
[31] Therefore they will eat from the fruit of their way,<br>
and they will be stuffed full of their own counsel.<br>
[32] For the waywardness of the<br>
simpletons will kill them,<br>
and the careless ease of fools will destroy them.<br>
[33] But the one who listens to me will live in security,<br>
and will be at ease from the dread of harm.”<br>
## Chapter 2

### Benefits of Seeking Wisdom

[1] My child, if you receive my words,<br>
and store up my commands inside yourself,<br>
[2] by making your ear attentive to wisdom,<br>
and by turning your heart to understanding,<br>
[3] indeed, if you call out for discernment —<br>
shout loudly for understanding—<br>
[4] if you seek it like silver,<br>
and search for it like hidden treasure,<br>
[5] then you will understand how to fear the **Lord**,<br>
and you will discover knowledge about God.<br>
[6] For the **Lord** gives wisdom,<br>
and from his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.<br>
[7] He stores up effective counsel for the upright,<br>
and is like a shield for those who live with integrity,<br>
[8] to guard the paths of the righteous<br>
and to protect the way of his pious ones.<br>
[9] Then you will understand righteousness and justice<br>
and equity—every good way.<br>
[10] For wisdom will enter your heart,<br>
and moral knowledge will be attractive to you.<br>
[11] Discretion will protect you,<br>
understanding will guard you,<br>
[12] to deliver you from the way of the wicked,<br>
from those speaking perversity,<br>
[13] who leave the upright paths<br>
to walk on the dark ways,<br>
[14] who delight in doing evil,<br>
they rejoice in perverse evil;<br>
[15] whose paths are morally crooked,<br>
and who are devious in their ways;<br>
[16] to deliver you from the adulterous woman,<br>
from the loose woman who has flattered you with her words;<br>
[17] who leaves the husband from her younger days,<br>
and has ignored her marriage covenant made before God.<br>
[18] For she has set her house by death,<br>
and her paths by the place of the departed spirits.<br>
[19] None who go in to her will return,<br>
nor will they reach the paths of life.<br>
[20] So you will walk in the way of good people,<br>
and will keep on the paths of the righteous.<br>
[21] For the upright will reside in the land,<br>
and those with integrity will remain in it,<br>
[22] but the wicked will be removed from the land,<br>
and the treacherous will be torn away from it.<br>
## Chapter 3

### Exhortations to Seek Wisdom and Walk with the Lord

[1] My child, do not forget my teaching,<br>
but let your heart keep my commandments,<br>
[2] for they will provide a long and full life,<br>
and well-being for you.<br>
[3] Do not let mercy and truth leave you;<br>
bind them around your neck,<br>
write them on the tablet of your heart.<br>
[4] Then you will find favor and good understanding,<br>
in the sight of God and people.<br>
[5] Trust in the **Lord** with all your heart,<br>
and do not rely on your own understanding.<br>
[6] Acknowledge him in all your ways,<br>
and he will make your paths straight.<br>
[7] Do not be wise in your own estimation;<br>
fear the **Lord** and turn away from evil.<br>
[8] This will bring healing to your body,<br>
and refreshment to your inner self.<br>
[9] Honor the **Lord** from your wealth<br>
and from the firstfruits of all your crops;<br>
[10] then your barns will be filled completely,<br>
and your vats will overflow with new wine.<br>
[11] My child, do not despise discipline from the **Lord**,<br>
and do not loathe his rebuke.<br>
[12] For the **Lord** disciplines those he loves,<br>
just as a father disciplines the son in whom he delights.<br>

### Blessings of Obtaining Wisdom

[13] Blessed is the one who has found wisdom,<br>
and the one who obtains understanding.<br>
[14] For her benefit is more profitable than silver,<br>
and her gain is better than gold.<br>
[15] She is more precious than rubies,<br>
and none of the things you desire can compare with her.<br>
[16] Long life is in her right hand;<br>
in her left hand are riches and honor.<br>
[17] Her ways are very pleasant,<br>
and all her paths are peaceful.<br>
[18] She is like a tree of life to those who grasp onto her,<br>
and everyone who takes hold of her will be blessed.<br>
[19] By wisdom the **Lord** laid the foundation of the earth;<br>
he established the heavens by understanding.<br>
[20] By his knowledge the primordial sea was broken open,<br>
so that the clouds drip down dew.<br>
[21] My child, do not let them escape from your sight;<br>
safeguard sound wisdom and discretion.<br>
[22] So they will become life for your soul,<br>
and grace around your neck.<br>
[23] Then you will walk on your way with security,<br>
and you will not stumble.<br>
[24] When you lie down you will not be filled with fear;<br>
when you lie down your sleep will be pleasant.<br>
[25] Do not be afraid of sudden disaster,<br>
or when destruction overtakes the wicked;<br>
[26] for the **Lord** will be the source of your confidence,<br>
and he will guard your foot from being caught in a trap.<br>

### Wisdom Demonstrated in Relationships with People

[27] Do not withhold good from those who need it,<br>
when you have the ability to help.<br>
[28] Do not say to your neighbor, “Go! Return tomorrow<br>
and I will give it,” when you have it with you at the time.<br>
[29] Do not plot evil against your neighbor<br>
when he dwells by you unsuspectingly.<br>
[30] Do not accuse anyone without legitimate cause,<br>
if he has not treated you wrongly.<br>
[31] Do not envy a violent man,<br>
and do not choose any of his ways;<br>
[32] for one who goes astray is an abomination to the **Lord**,<br>
but he reveals his intimate counsel to the upright.<br>
[33] The **Lord**’s curse is on the household of the wicked,<br>
but he blesses the home of the righteous.<br>
[34] With arrogant scoffers he is scornful,<br>
yet he shows favor to the humble.<br>
[35] The wise inherit honor,<br>
but he holds fools up to public contempt.<br>
## Chapter 4

### Admonition to Follow Righteousness and Avoid Wickedness

[1] Listen, children, to a father’s instruction,<br>
and pay attention so that you may gain discernment.<br>
[2] Because I hereby give you good instruction,<br>
do not forsake my teaching.<br>

[3] When I was a son to my father,<br>
a tender, only child before my mother,<br>
[4] he taught me, and he said to me:<br>
“Let your heart lay hold of my words;<br>
keep my commands so that you will live.<br>
[5] Acquire wisdom, acquire understanding;<br>
do not forget and do not turn aside from the words I speak.<br>
[6] Do not forsake wisdom, and she will protect you;<br>
love her, and she will guard you.<br>
[7] Wisdom is supreme —so acquire wisdom,<br>
and whatever you acquire, acquire understanding!<br>
[8] Esteem her highly and she will exalt you;<br>
she will honor you if you embrace her.<br>
[9] She will place a fair garland on your head;<br>
she will bestow a beautiful crown on you.”<br>
[10] Listen, my child, and accept my words,<br>
so that the years of your life will be many.<br>
[11] I hereby guide you in the way of wisdom<br>
and I lead you in upright paths.<br>
[12] When you walk, your steps will not be hampered,<br>
and when you run, you will not stumble.<br>
[13] Hold on to instruction, do not let it go;<br>
protect it, because it is your life.<br>
[14] Do not enter the path of the wicked<br>
or walk in the way of those who are evil.<br>
[15] Avoid it, do not go on it;<br>
turn away from it, and go on.<br>
[16] For they cannot sleep unless they cause harm;<br>
they are robbed of sleep until they make someone stumble.<br>
[17] Indeed they have eaten bread gained from wickedness<br>
and drink wine obtained from violence.<br>
[18] But the path of the righteous is like the bright morning light,<br>
growing brighter and brighter until full day.<br>
[19] The way of the wicked is like gloomy darkness;<br>
they do not know what they stumble over.<br>

[20] My child, pay attention to my words;<br>
listen attentively to my sayings.<br>
[21] Do not let them depart from your sight,<br>
guard them within your heart;<br>
[22] for they are life to those who find them<br>
and healing to one’s entire body.<br>
[23] Guard your heart with all vigilance,<br>
for from it are the sources of life.<br>
[24] Remove perverse speech from your mouth;<br>
keep devious talk far from your lips.<br>
[25] Let your eyes look directly in front of you<br>
and let your gaze look straight before you.<br>
[26] Make the path for your feet level,<br>
so that all your ways may be established.<br>
[27] Do not turn to the right or to the left;<br>
turn yourself away from evil.<br>
## Chapter 5

### Admonition to Avoid Seduction to Evil

[1] My child, be attentive to my wisdom,<br>
pay close attention to my understanding,<br>
[2] in order to safeguard discretion,<br>
and that your lips may guard knowledge.<br>
[3] For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey,<br>
and her seductive words are smoother than olive oil,<br>
[4] but in the end she is bitter as wormwood,<br>
sharp as a two-edged sword.<br>
[5] Her feet go down to death;<br>
her steps lead straight to the grave.<br>
[6] Lest she should make level the path leading to life,<br>
her paths have wandered, but she is not able to discern it.<br>
[7] So now, children, listen to me;<br>
do not turn aside from the words I speak.<br>
[8] Keep yourself far from her,<br>
and do not go near the door of her house,<br>
[9] lest you give your vigor to others<br>
and your years to a cruel person,<br>
[10] lest strangers devour your strength,<br>
and your labor benefit another man’s house.<br>
[11] And at the end of your life you will groan<br>
when your flesh and your body are wasted away.<br>
[12] And you will say, “How I hated discipline!<br>
My heart spurned reproof!<br>
[13] For I did not obey my teachers<br>
and I did not heed my instructors.<br>
[14] I almost came to complete ruin<br>
in the midst of the whole congregation!”<br>
[15] Drink water from your own cistern<br>
and running water from your own well.<br>
[16] Should your springs be dispersed outside,<br>
your streams of water in the wide plazas?<br>
[17] Let them be for yourself alone,<br>
and not for strangers with you.<br>
[18] May your fountain be blessed,<br>
and may you rejoice in the wife you married in your youth —<br>
[19] a loving doe, a graceful deer;<br>
may her breasts satisfy you at all times,<br>
may you be captivated by her love always.<br>
[20] But why should you be captivated, my son, by an adulteress,<br>
and embrace the bosom of a different woman?<br>
[21] For the ways of a person are in front of the **Lord**’s eyes,<br>
and the **Lord** weighs all that person’s paths.<br>
[22] The wicked will be captured by his own iniquities,<br>
and he will be held by the cords of his own sin.<br>
[23] He will die because there was no discipline;<br>
because of the greatness of his folly he will reel.<br>
## Chapter 6

### Admonitions and Warnings against Dangerous and Destructive Acts

[1] My child, if you have made a pledge for your neighbor,<br>
if you have become a guarantor for a stranger,<br>
[2] if you have been ensnared by the words you have uttered,<br>
and have been caught by the words you have spoken,<br>
[3] then, my child, do this in order to deliver yourself,<br>
because you have fallen into your neighbor’s power:<br>
Go, humble yourself,<br>
and appeal firmly to your neighbor.<br>
[4] Permit no sleep to your eyes<br>
or slumber to your eyelids.<br>
[5] Deliver yourself like a gazelle from a snare,<br>
and like a bird from the trap of the fowler.<br>
[6] Go to the ant, you sluggard;<br>
observe her ways and be wise!<br>
[7] It has no commander,<br>
overseer, or ruler,<br>
[8] yet it would prepare its food in the summer;<br>
it gathered at the harvest what it will eat.<br>
[9] How long, you sluggard, will you lie there?<br>
When will you rise from your sleep?<br>
[10] A little sleep, a little slumber,<br>
a little folding of the hands to relax,<br>
[11] and your poverty will come like a robber,<br>
and your need like an armed man.<br>
[12] A worthless and wicked person<br>
walks around saying perverse things;<br>
[13] he winks with his eyes,<br>
signals with his feet,<br>
and points with his fingers;<br>
[14] he plots evil with perverse thoughts in his heart,<br>
he spreads contention at all times.<br>
[15] Therefore, his disaster will come suddenly;<br>
in an instant he will be broken, and there will be no remedy.<br>
[16] There are six things that the **Lord** hates,<br>
even seven things that are an abomination to him:<br>
[17] haughty eyes, a lying tongue,<br>
and hands that shed innocent blood,<br>
[18] a heart that devises wicked plans,<br>
feet that are swift to run to evil,<br>
[19] a false witness who pours out lies,<br>
and a person who spreads discord among family members.<br>
[20] My child, guard the commands of your father<br>
and do not forsake the instruction of your mother.<br>
[21] Bind them on your heart continually;<br>
fasten them around your neck.<br>
[22] When you walk about, they will guide you;<br>
when you lie down, they will watch over you;<br>
when you wake up, they will talk to you.<br>
[23] For the commandments are like a lamp,<br>
instruction is like a light,<br>
and rebukes of discipline are like the road leading to life,<br>
[24] by keeping you from the evil woman,<br>
from the smooth tongue of the loose woman.<br>
[25] Do not lust in your heart for her beauty,<br>
and do not let her captivate you with her alluring eyes;<br>
[26] for on account of a prostitute one is brought down to a loaf of bread,<br>
but the wife of another man preys on your precious life.<br>
[27] Can a man hold fire against his chest<br>
without burning his clothes?<br>
[28] Can a man walk on hot coals<br>
without scorching his feet?<br>
[29] So it is with the one who sleeps with his neighbor’s wife;<br>
no one who touches her will escape punishment.<br>
[30] People do not despise a thief when he steals<br>
to fulfill his need when he is hungry.<br>
[31] Yet if he is caught he must repay seven times over,<br>
he might even have to give all the wealth of his house.<br>
[32] A man who commits adultery with a woman lacks sense,<br>
whoever does it destroys his own life.<br>
[33] He will be beaten and despised,<br>
and his reproach will not be wiped away;<br>
[34] for jealousy kindles a husband’s rage,<br>
and he will not show mercy when he takes revenge.<br>
[35] He will not consider any compensation;<br>
he will not be willing, even if you multiply the compensation.<br>
## Chapter 7

### Admonition to Avoid the Wiles of the Adulteress

[1] My child, devote yourself to my words<br>
and store up my commands inside yourself.<br>
[2] Keep my commands so that you may live,<br>
and obey my instruction as your most prized possession.<br>
[3] Bind them on your forearm;<br>
write them on the tablet of your heart.<br>
[4] Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,”<br>
and call understanding a close relative,<br>
[5] so that they may keep you from the adulterous woman,<br>
from the loose woman who has flattered you with her words.<br>
[6] For at the window of my house<br>
through my window lattice I looked out<br>
[7] and I saw among the naive —<br>
I discerned among the youths —<br>
a young man who lacked sense.<br>
[8] He was passing by the street near her corner,<br>
making his way along the road to her house<br>
[9] in the twilight, the evening,<br>
in the dark of the night.<br>
[10] Suddenly a woman came out to meet him!<br>
She was dressed like a prostitute and with secret intent.<br>
[11] (She is loud and rebellious,<br>
she does not remain at home—<br>
[12] at one time outside, at another in the wide plazas,<br>
and by every corner she lies in wait.)<br>
[13] So she grabbed him and kissed him,<br>
and with a bold expression she said to him,<br>
[14] “I have meat from my peace offerings at home;<br>
today I have fulfilled my vows!<br>
[15] That is why I came out to meet you,<br>
to look for you, and I found you!<br>
[16] I have spread my bed with elegant coverings,<br>
with richly colored fabric from Egypt.<br>
[17] I have perfumed my bed<br>
with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.<br>
[18] Come, let’s drink deeply of lovemaking until morning,<br>
let’s delight ourselves with love’s pleasures.<br>
[19] For my husband is not at home;<br>
he has gone on a journey of some distance.<br>
[20] He has taken a bag of money with him;<br>
he will not return until the end of the month.”<br>
[21] She turned him aside with her persuasions;<br>
with her smooth talk she was enticing him along.<br>
[22] Suddenly he was going after her<br>
like an ox that goes to the slaughter,<br>
like a stag prancing into a trapper’s snare<br>
[23] till an arrow pierces his liver —<br>
like a bird hurrying into a trap,<br>
and he does not know that it will cost him his life.<br>
[24] So now, sons, listen to me,<br>
and pay attention to the words I speak.<br>
[25] Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways—<br>
do not wander into her pathways;<br>
[26] for she has brought down many fatally wounded,<br>
and all those she has slain are many.<br>
[27] Her house is the way to the grave,<br>
going down to the chambers of death.<br>
## Chapter 8

### The Appeal of Wisdom

[1] Does not wisdom call out?<br>
Does not understanding raise her voice?<br>
[2] At the top of the prominent places along the way,<br>
at the intersection of the paths she has taken her stand;<br>
[3] beside the gates opening into the city,<br>
at the entrance of the doorways she cries out:<br>
[4] “To you, O people, I call out,<br>
and my voice calls to all mankind.<br>
[5] You who are naive, discern wisdom!<br>
And you fools, understand discernment!<br>
[6] Listen, for I will speak excellent things,<br>
and my lips will utter what is right.<br>
[7] For my mouth speaks truth,<br>
and my lips hate wickedness.<br>
[8] All the words of my mouth are righteous;<br>
there is nothing in them twisted or crooked.<br>
[9] All of them are clear to the discerning<br>
and upright to those who find knowledge.<br>
[10] Receive my instruction rather than silver,<br>
and knowledge rather than choice gold.<br>
[11] For wisdom is better than rubies,<br>
and desirable things cannot be compared to her.<br>
[12] “I, wisdom, have dwelt with prudence,<br>
and I find knowledge and discretion.<br>
[13] The fear of the **Lord** is to hate evil;<br>
I hate arrogant pride and the evil way<br>
and perverse utterances.<br>
[14] Counsel and sound wisdom belong to me;<br>
I possess understanding and might.<br>
[15] By me kings reign,<br>
and by me potentates decree righteousness;<br>
[16] by me princes rule,<br>
as well as nobles and all righteous judges.<br>
[17] I will love those who love me,<br>
and those who seek me diligently will find me.<br>
[18] Riches and honor are with me,<br>
long-lasting wealth and righteousness.<br>
[19] My fruit is better than the purest gold,<br>
and my harvest is better than choice silver.<br>
[20] I walk in the path of righteousness,<br>
in the pathway of justice,<br>
[21] that I may cause those who love me to inherit wealth,<br>
and that I may fill their treasuries.<br>
[22] The **Lord** created me as the beginning of his works,<br>
before his deeds of long ago.<br>
[23] From eternity I have been fashioned,<br>
from the beginning, from before the world existed.<br>
[24] When there were no deep oceans I was born,<br>
when there were no springs overflowing with water;<br>
[25] before the mountains were set in place—<br>
before the hills—I was born,<br>
[26] before he made the earth and its fields,<br>
or the top soil of the world.<br>
[27] When he established the heavens, I was there;<br>
when he marked out the horizon over the face of the deep,<br>
[28] when he established the clouds above,<br>
when he secured the fountains of the deep,<br>
[29] when he gave the sea his decree<br>
that the waters should not pass over his command,<br>
when he marked out the foundations of the earth,<br>
[30] then I was beside him as a master craftsman,<br>
and I was his delight day by day,<br>
rejoicing before him at all times,<br>
[31] rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth,<br>
and delighting in its people.<br>

[32] “So now, children, listen to me;<br>
blessed are those who keep my ways.<br>
[33] Listen to my instruction so that you may be wise,<br>
and do not neglect it.<br>
[34] Blessed is the one who listens to me,<br>
watching at my doors day by day,<br>
waiting beside my doorway.<br>
[35] For the one who finds me has found life<br>
and received favor from the **Lord**.<br>
[36] But the one who misses me brings harm to himself;<br>
all who hate me love death.”<br>
## Chapter 9

### The Consequences of Accepting Wisdom or Folly

[1] Wisdom has built her house;<br>
she has carved out its seven pillars.<br>
[2] She has prepared her meat, she has mixed her wine;<br>
she also has arranged her table.<br>
[3] She has sent out her female servants;<br>
she calls out on the highest places of the city.<br>
[4] “Whoever is naive, let him turn in here.”<br>
To those who lack understanding, she has said,<br>
[5] “Come, eat some of my food,<br>
and drink some of the wine I have mixed.<br>
[6] Abandon your foolish ways so that you may live,<br>
and proceed in the way of understanding.”<br>
[7] Whoever corrects a mocker is asking for insult;<br>
whoever reproves a wicked person receives abuse.<br>
[8] Do not reprove a mocker or he will hate you;<br>
reprove a wise person and he will love you.<br>
[9] Give instruction to a wise person, and he will become wiser still;<br>
teach a righteous person and he will add to his learning.<br>
[10] The beginning of wisdom is to fear the **Lord**,<br>
and acknowledging the Holy One is understanding.<br>
[11] For because of me your days will be many,<br>
and years will be added to your life.<br>
[12] If you are wise, you are wise to your own advantage,<br>
but if you have mocked, you alone must bear it.<br>
[13] The woman called Folly is brash,<br>
she is naive and does not know anything.<br>
[14] And she has sat down at the door of her house,<br>
on a seat at the highest point of the city,<br>
[15] calling out to those who are passing by her in the way,<br>
who go straight on their way.<br>
[16] “Whoever is naive, let him turn in here,”<br>
To those who lack understanding she has said,<br>
[17] “Stolen waters are sweet,<br>
and food obtained in secret is pleasant!”<br>
[18] But they do not realize that the dead are there,<br>
that her guests are in the depths of the grave.<br>
## Chapter 10

### The First Collection of Solomonic Proverbs

[1] The proverbs of Solomon:<br>

A wise child makes a father rejoice,<br>

[16] A person’s gift makes room for him,<br>
and leads him before important people.<br>
[17] The first to state his case seems right,<br>
until his opponent begins to cross-examine him.<br>
[18] A toss of a coin ends disputes,<br>
and settles the issue between strong opponents.<br>
[19] A relative offended is harder to reach than a strong city,<br>
and disputes are like the barred gates of a fortified citadel.<br>
[20] From the fruit of a person’s mouth his stomach will be satisfied,<br>
with the product of his lips he will be satisfied.<br>
[21] Death and life are in the power of the tongue,<br>
and those who love its use will eat its fruit.<br>
[22] The one who has found a good wife has found what goodness is,<br>
and obtained a delightful gift from the **Lord**.<br>
[23] A poor person makes supplications,<br>
but a rich man answers harshly.<br>
[24] There are companions who harm one another,<br>
but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.<br>
## Chapter 19

[1] Better is a poor person who walks in his integrity<br>
than one who is perverse in his speech and is a fool.<br>
[2] It is dangerous to have zeal without knowledge,<br>
and the one who acts hastily makes poor choices.<br>
[3] A person’s folly subverts his way,<br>
and his heart rages against the **Lord**.<br>
[4] Wealth adds many friends,<br>
but a poor person is separated from his friend.<br>
[5] A false witness will not go unpunished,<br>
and the one who spouts out lies will not escape punishment.<br>
[6] Many people entreat the favor of a generous person,<br>
and everyone is the friend of the person who gives gifts.<br>
[7] All the relatives of a poor person hate him;<br>
how much more do his friends avoid him—<br>
one who chases words, which are nothing.<br>
[8] The one who acquires understanding loves himself;<br>
the one who preserves understanding will prosper.<br>
[9] A false witness will not go unpunished,<br>
and the one who spouts out lies will perish.<br>
[10] Luxury is not appropriate for a fool;<br>
how much less for a servant to rule over princes!<br>
[11] A person’s wisdom has made him slow to anger,<br>
and it is his glory to overlook an offense.<br>
[12] A king’s wrath is like the roar of a lion,<br>
but his favor is like dew on the grass.<br>
[13] A foolish child is the ruin of his father,<br>
and a contentious wife is like a constant dripping.<br>
[14] A house and wealth are inherited from parents,<br>
but a prudent wife is from the **Lord**.<br>
[15] Laziness brings on a deep sleep,<br>
and the idle person will go hungry.<br>
[16] The one who obeys commandments guards his life;<br>
the one who despises his ways will die.<br>
[17] The one who is gracious to the poor lends to the **Lord**,<br>
and the **Lord** will repay him for his good deed.<br>
[18] Discipline your child, for there is hope,<br>
but do not set your heart on causing his death.<br>
[19] A person with great anger bears the penalty,<br>
but if you deliver him from it once, you will have to do it again.<br>
[20] Listen to advice and receive discipline,<br>
that you may become wise by the end of your life.<br>
[21] There are many plans in a person’s mind,<br>
but it is the counsel of the **Lord** that will stand.<br>
[22] What is desirable for a person is to show loyal love,<br>
and a poor person is better than a liar.<br>
[23] Fearing the **Lord** leads to life,<br>
and one who does so will live satisfied; he will not be afflicted by calamity.<br>
[24] The sluggard has plunged his hand into the dish,<br>
and he will not even bring it back to his mouth!<br>
[25] Flog a scorner, and as a result the simpleton will learn prudence;<br>
correct a discerning person, and as a result he will understand knowledge.<br>
[26] The one who robs his father and chases away his mother<br>
is a son who brings shame and disgrace.<br>
[27] If you stop listening to instruction, my child,<br>
you will stray from the words of knowledge.<br>
[28] A crooked witness scorns justice,<br>
and the mouth of the wicked devours iniquity.<br>
[29] Penalties have been prepared for scorners,<br>
and floggings for the backs of fools.<br>
## Chapter 20

[1] Wine is a mocker and strong drink is a brawler;<br>
whoever goes astray by them is not wise.<br>
[2] The king’s terrifying anger is like the roar of a lion;<br>
whoever provokes him sins against himself.<br>
[3] It is an honor for a person to cease from strife,<br>
but every fool quarrels.<br>
[4] The sluggard will not plow during the planting season,<br>
so at harvest time he asks for grain but has nothing.<br>
[5] Counsel in a person’s heart is like deep water,<br>
but an understanding person draws it out.<br>
[6] Many people profess their loyalty,<br>
but a faithful person —who can find?<br>
[7] The righteous person behaves in integrity;<br>
blessed are his children after him.<br>
[8] A king sitting on the throne to judge<br>
separates out all evil with his eyes.<br>
[9] Who can say, “I have kept my heart clean;<br>
I am pure from my sin”?<br>
[10] Diverse weights and diverse measures —<br>
the **Lord** abhors both of them.<br>
[11] Even a young man is known by his actions,<br>
whether his activity is pure and whether it is right.<br>
[12] The ear that hears and the eye that sees —<br>
the **Lord** has made them both.<br>
[13] Do not love sleep, lest you become impoverished;<br>
open your eyes so that you might be satisfied with food.<br>
[14] “It’s worthless! It’s worthless!” says the buyer,<br>
but when he goes on his way, he boasts.<br>
[15] There is gold, and an abundance of rubies,<br>
but words of knowledge are like a precious jewel.<br>
[16] Take a man’s garment when he has given security for a stranger,<br>
and hold him in pledge on behalf of strangers.<br>
[17] Bread gained by deceit tastes sweet to a person,<br>
but afterward his mouth will be filled with gravel.<br>
[18] Plans are established by counsel,<br>
so make war with guidance.<br>
[19] The one who goes about gossiping reveals secrets;<br>
therefore do not associate with someone who is always opening his mouth.<br>
[20] The one who curses his father and his mother,<br>
his lamp will be extinguished in the blackest darkness.<br>
[21] An inheritance gained easily in the beginning<br>
will not be blessed in the end.<br>
[22] Do not say, “I will pay back evil!”<br>
Wait for the **Lord**, so that he may vindicate you.<br>
[23] The **Lord** abhors differing weights,<br>
and dishonest scales are wicked.<br>
[24] The steps of a person are ordained by the **Lord**—<br>
so how can anyone understand his own way?<br>
[25] It is a snare for a person to rashly cry, “Holy!”<br>
and only afterward to consider what he has vowed.<br>
[26] A wise king separates out the wicked;<br>
he turns the threshing wheel over them.<br>
[27] The human spirit is like the lamp of the **Lord**,<br>
searching all his innermost parts.<br>
[28] Loyal love and truth preserve a king,<br>
and his throne is upheld by loyal love.<br>
[29] The glory of young men is their strength,<br>
and the splendor of old men is gray hair.<br>
[30] Beatings and wounds cleanse away evil,<br>
and floggings cleanse the innermost being.<br>
## Chapter 21

[1] The king’s heart is in the hand of the **Lord** like channels of water;<br>
he turns it wherever he wants.<br>
[2] All a person’s ways seem right in his own opinion,<br>
but the **Lord** evaluates his thoughts.<br>
[3] To do righteousness and justice<br>
is more acceptable to the **Lord** than sacrifice.<br>
[4] Haughty eyes and a proud heart—<br>
what the wicked cultivate is sin.<br>
[5] The plans of the diligent lead only to plenty,<br>
but everyone who is hasty comes only to poverty.<br>
[6] Making a fortune by a lying tongue is like a vapor driven back and forth;<br>
they seek death.<br>
[7] The violence done by the wicked will drag them away<br>
because they have refused to do what is right.<br>
[8] The way of the guilty person is devious,<br>
but as for the pure, his way is upright.<br>
[9] It is better to live on a corner of the housetop<br>
than to share a house with a quarrelsome wife.<br>
[10] The appetite of the wicked has desired evil;<br>
his neighbor is shown no favor in his eyes.<br>
[11] When a scorner is punished, the naive becomes wise;<br>
when a wise person is instructed, he gains knowledge.<br>
[12] The Righteous One considers the house of the wicked;<br>
he overthrows the wicked to their ruin.<br>
[13] The one who shuts his ears to the cry of the poor,<br>
he too will cry out and will not be answered.<br>
[14] A gift given in secret subdues anger,<br>
and a bribe given secretly subdues strong wrath.<br>
[15] Doing justice brings joy to the righteous<br>
and terror to those who do evil.<br>
[16] The one who wanders from the way of wisdom<br>
will end up in the company of the departed.<br>
[17] The one who loves pleasure will be a poor person;<br>
whoever loves wine and anointing oil will not be rich.<br>
[18] The wicked become a ransom for the righteous,<br>
and the treacherous are taken in the place of the upright.<br>
[19] It is better to live in the wilderness<br>
than with a quarrelsome and easily provoked woman.<br>
[20] There is desirable treasure and olive oil in the dwelling of the wise,<br>
but a foolish person devours all he has.<br>
[21] The one who pursues righteousness and love<br>
finds life, bounty, and honor.<br>
[22] A wise man went up against the city of the mighty<br>
and brought down the stronghold in which they trust.<br>
[23] The one who guards his mouth and his tongue<br>
keeps his life from troubles.<br>
[24] A proud and arrogant person, whose name is “Scoffer,”<br>
acts with overbearing pride.<br>
[25] What the sluggard desires will kill him,<br>
for his hands have refused to work.<br>
[26] All day long he has craved greedily,<br>
but the righteous person gives and does not hold back.<br>
[27] The wicked person’s sacrifice is an abomination;<br>
how much more when he brings it with evil intent!<br>
[28] A lying witness will perish,<br>
but the one who reports accurately speaks forever.<br>
[29] A wicked person has put on a bold face,<br>
but as for the upright, he establishes his ways.<br>
[30] There is no wisdom and there is no understanding,<br>
and there is no counsel against the **Lord**.<br>
[31] A horse is prepared for the day of battle,<br>
but the victory is from the **Lord**.<br>
## Chapter 22

[1] A good name is to be chosen rather than great wealth,<br>
good favor more than silver or gold.<br>
[2] The rich and the poor are met together;<br>
the **Lord** is the Creator of them both.<br>
[3] A shrewd person saw danger and hid himself,<br>
but the naive passed on by and paid for it.<br>
[4] The reward for humility and fearing the **Lord**<br>
is riches and honor and life.<br>
[5] Thorns and snares are in the path of the perverse,<br>
but the one who guards himself keeps far from them.<br>
[6] Train a child in the way that he should go,<br>
and when he is old he will not turn from it.<br>
[7] The rich rule over the poor,<br>
and the borrower is servant to the lender.<br>
[8] The one who sows iniquity will reap trouble,<br>
and the rod of his fury will end.<br>
[9] A generous person will be blessed,<br>
for he has given some of his food to the poor.<br>
[10] Drive out the scorner and contention will leave;<br>
strife and insults will cease.<br>
[11] The one who loves a pure heart<br>
and whose speech is gracious —the king will be his friend.<br>
[12] The eyes of the **Lord** watched over a cause,<br>
and subverted the words of the treacherous person.<br>
[13] The sluggard has said, “There is a lion outside!<br>
I will be killed in the middle of the streets!”<br>
[14] The mouth of an adulteress is like a deep pit;<br>
the one against whom the **Lord** is angry will fall into it.<br>
[15] Folly is bound up in the heart of a child,<br>
but the rod of discipline will drive it far from him.<br>
[16] The one who oppresses the poor to increase his own gain<br>
and the one who gives to the rich —both end up only in poverty.<br>

### The Sayings of the Wise

[17] Incline your ear and listen to the words of the wise,<br>
and apply your mind to my instruction.<br>
[18] For it is pleasing if you keep these sayings within you,<br>
and they are ready on your lips.<br>
[19] So that your confidence may be in the **Lord**,<br>
I hereby make them known to you today—even you.<br>
[20] Have I not written thirty sayings for you,<br>
sayings of counsel and knowledge,<br>
[21] to show you true and reliable words,<br>
so that you may give accurate answers to those who sent you?<br>
[22] Do not exploit a poor person because he is poor<br>
and do not crush the needy in court,<br>
[23] for the **Lord** will plead their case<br>
and will rob the life of those who are robbing them.<br>
[24] Do not make friends with an angry person,<br>
and do not associate with a wrathful person,<br>
[25] lest you learn his ways<br>
and entangle yourself in a snare.<br>
[26] Do not be one who strikes hands in pledge<br>
or who puts up security for debts.<br>
[27] If you do not have enough to pay,<br>
your bed will be taken right out from under you!<br>
[28] Do not move an ancient boundary stone<br>
that was put in place by your ancestors.<br>
[29] You have seen a person skilled in his work—<br>
he will take his position before kings;<br>
he will not take his position before obscure people.<br>
## Chapter 23

[1] When you sit down to eat with a ruler,<br>
consider carefully what is before you,<br>
[2] and put a knife to your throat<br>
if you possess a large appetite.<br>
[3] Do not crave that ruler’s delicacies,<br>
for that food is deceptive.<br>
[4] Do not wear yourself out to become rich;<br>
be wise enough to restrain yourself.<br>
[5] When you gaze upon riches, they are gone,<br>
for they surely make wings for themselves,<br>
and fly off into the sky like an eagle!<br>
[6] Do not eat the food of a stingy person,<br>
do not crave his delicacies;<br>
[7] for he is like someone who has calculated the cost in his mind.<br>
“Eat and drink,” he says to you,<br>
but his heart is not with you;<br>
[8] you will vomit up the little bit you have eaten,<br>
and will have wasted your pleasant words.<br>
[9] Do not speak in the ears of a fool,<br>
for he will despise the wisdom of your words.<br>
[10] Do not move an ancient boundary stone,<br>
or take over the fields of the fatherless,<br>
[11] for their Protector is strong;<br>
he will plead their case against you.<br>
[12] Apply your heart to instruction<br>
and your ears to the words of knowledge.<br>
[13] Do not withhold discipline from a child;<br>
even if you strike him with the rod, he will not die.<br>
[14] If you strike him with the rod,<br>
you will deliver him from death.<br>
[15] My child, if your heart is wise,<br>
then my heart also will be glad;<br>
[16] my soul will rejoice<br>
when your lips speak what is right.<br>
[17] Do not let your heart envy sinners,<br>
but rather be zealous in fearing the **Lord** all the time.<br>
[18] For surely there is a future,<br>
and your hope will not be cut off.<br>
[19] Listen, my child, and be wise,<br>
and guide your heart on the right way.<br>
[20] Do not spend time among drunkards,<br>
among those who eat too much meat,<br>
[21] because drunkards and gluttons become impoverished,<br>
and drowsiness clothes them with rags.<br>
[22] Listen to your father who gave you life,<br>
and do not despise your mother when she is old.<br>
[23] Acquire truth and do not sell it—<br>
wisdom, and discipline, and understanding.<br>
[24] The father of a righteous person will rejoice greatly;<br>
whoever fathers a wise child will have joy in him.<br>
[25] May your father and your mother have joy;<br>
may she who bore you rejoice.<br>
[26] Give me your heart, my son,<br>
and let your eyes observe my ways;<br>
[27] for a prostitute is like a deep pit;<br>
a harlot is like a narrow well.<br>
[28] Indeed, she lies in wait like a robber,<br>
and increases the unfaithful among men.<br>
[29] Who has woe? Who has sorrow?<br>
Who has contentions? Who has complaints?<br>
Who has wounds without cause? Who has dullness of the eyes?<br>
[30] Those who linger over wine,<br>
those who go looking for mixed wine.<br>
[31] Do not look on the wine when it is red,<br>
when it sparkles in the cup,<br>
when it goes down smoothly.<br>
[32] Afterward it bites like a snake,<br>
and stings like a viper.<br>
[33] Your eyes will see strange things,<br>
and your mind will speak perverse things.<br>
[34] And you will be like one who lies down in the midst of the sea,<br>
and like one who lies down on the top of the rigging.<br>
[35] You will say, “They have struck me, but I am not harmed!<br>
They beat me, but I did not know it!<br>
When will I awake? I will look for another drink.”<br>
## Chapter 24

[1] Do not envy evil people,<br>
do not desire to be with them;<br>
[2] for their hearts contemplate violence,<br>
and their lips speak harm.<br>
[3] By wisdom a house is built,<br>
and through understanding it is established;<br>
[4] by knowledge its rooms are filled<br>
with all kinds of precious and pleasing treasures.<br>
[5] A wise warrior is strong,<br>
and a man of knowledge makes his strength stronger;<br>
[6] for with guidance you wage your war,<br>
and with numerous advisers there is victory.<br>
[7] Wisdom is unattainable for a fool;<br>
in court he does not open his mouth.<br>
[8] The one who plans to do evil<br>
will be called a scheming person.<br>
[9] A foolish scheme is sin,<br>
and the scorner is an abomination to people.<br>
[10] You have slacked off in the day of trouble —<br>
your strength is small!<br>
[11] Deliver those being taken away to death,<br>
and hold back those slipping to the slaughter.<br>
[12] If you say, “But we did not know about this,”<br>
won’t the one who evaluates hearts discern it?<br>
Won’t the one who guards your life realize<br>
and repay each person according to his deeds?<br>
[13] Eat honey, my child, for it is good,<br>
and honey from the honeycomb is sweet to your taste.<br>
[14] Likewise, know that wisdom is sweet to your soul;<br>
if you have found it, you have a future,<br>
and your hope will not be cut off.<br>
[15] Do not lie in wait like the wicked against the place where the righteous live;<br>
do not assault his home.<br>
[16] Indeed a righteous person will fall seven times, and then get up again,<br>
but the guilty will collapse in calamity.<br>
[17] Do not rejoice when your enemy falls,<br>
and when he stumbles do not let your heart rejoice,<br>
[18] lest the **Lord** see it, and be displeased,<br>
and turn his wrath away from him.<br>
[19] Do not fret because of evil people<br>
or be envious of wicked people,<br>
[20] for the evil person has no future,<br>
and the lamp of the wicked will be extinguished.<br>
[21] Fear the **Lord**, my child, as well as the king,<br>
and do not associate with rebels,<br>
[22] for suddenly their destruction will overtake them,<br>
and who knows the ruinous judgment both the **Lord** and the king can bring?<br>

### Further Sayings of the Wise

[23] These sayings also are from the wise:

To show partiality in judgment is terrible:<br>
[24] The one who says to the guilty, “You are innocent,”<br>
peoples will curse him, and nations will denounce him.<br>
[25] But there will be delight for those who convict the guilty,<br>
and a pleasing blessing will come on them.<br>
[26] Like a kiss on the lips<br>
is the one who gives an honest answer.<br>
[27] Establish your work outside and get your fields ready;<br>
afterward build your house.<br>
[28] Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause,<br>
and do not deceive with your words.<br>
[29] Do not say, “I will do to him just as he has done to me;<br>
I will pay him back according to what he has done.”<br>
[30] I passed by the field of a sluggard,<br>
by the vineyard of one who lacks sense.<br>
[31] I saw that thorns had grown up all over it,<br>
the ground was covered with weeds,<br>
and its stone wall was broken down.<br>
[32] Then I scrutinized it. I was putting my mind to it—<br>
I saw; I took in a lesson:<br>
[33] “A little sleep, a little slumber,<br>
a little folding of the hands to relax,<br>
[34] and your poverty will come like a bandit,<br>
and your need like an armed robber.”<br>
## Chapter 25

### Proverbs of Solomon Collected by Hezekiah

[1] These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of King Hezekiah of Judah copied:


[2] It is the glory of God to conceal a matter,<br>
and it is the glory of a king to search out a matter.<br>
[3] As the heaven is high and the earth is deep<br>
so the hearts of kings are unsearchable.<br>
[4] Remove the dross from the silver,<br>
and material for the silversmith will emerge;<br>
[5] remove the wicked from before the king,<br>
and his throne will be established in righteousness.<br>
[6] Do not honor yourself before the king,<br>
and do not stand in the place of great men;<br>
[7] for it is better for him to say to you, “Come up here,”<br>
than to put you lower before a prince,<br>
whom your eyes have seen.<br>
[8] Do not go out hastily to litigation,<br>
or what will you do afterward<br>
when your neighbor puts you to shame?<br>
[9] When you argue a case with your neighbor,<br>
do not reveal the secret of another person,<br>
[10] lest the one who hears it put you to shame<br>
and your infamy will never go away.<br>
[11] Like apples of gold in settings of silver,<br>
so is a word skillfully spoken.<br>
[12] Like an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold,<br>
so is a wise reprover to the ear of the one who listens.<br>
[13] Like the cold of snow in the time of harvest,<br>
so is a faithful messenger to those who send him,<br>
for he refreshes the heart of his masters.<br>
[14] Like cloudy skies and wind that produce no rain,<br>
so is the one who boasts of a gift not given.<br>
[15] Through patience a ruler can be persuaded,<br>
and a soft tongue can break a bone.<br>
[16] You have found honey—eat only what is sufficient for you,<br>
lest you become stuffed with it and vomit it up.<br>
[17] Don’t set foot too frequently in your neighbor’s house,<br>
lest he become weary of you and hate you.<br>
[18] Like a club or a sword or a sharp arrow,<br>
so is the one who testifies against his neighbor as a false witness.<br>
[19] Like a bad tooth or a foot out of joint,<br>
so is confidence in an unfaithful person at the time of trouble.<br>
[20] Like one who takes off a garment on a cold day,<br>
or like vinegar poured on soda,<br>
so is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.<br>
[21] If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat,<br>
and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink,<br>
[22] for you will heap coals of fire on his head,<br>
and the **Lord** will reward you.<br>
[23] The north wind brings forth rain,<br>
and a gossiping tongue brings forth an angry look.<br>
[24] It is better to live on a corner of the housetop<br>
than in a house in company with a quarrelsome wife.<br>
[25] Like cold water to a weary person,<br>
so is good news from a distant land.<br>
[26] Like a muddied spring and a polluted well,<br>
so is a righteous person who gives way before the wicked.<br>
[27] It is not good to eat too much honey,<br>
nor is it honorable for people to seek their own glory.<br>
[28] Like a city that is broken down and without a wall,<br>
so is a person who cannot control his temper.<br>
## Chapter 26

[1] Like snow in summer or rain in harvest,<br>
so honor is not fitting for a fool.<br>
[2] Like a fluttering bird or like a flying swallow,<br>
so a curse without cause does not come to rest.<br>
[3] A whip for the horse and a bridle for the donkey,<br>
and a rod for the backs of fools!<br>
[4] Do not answer a fool according to his folly,<br>
lest you yourself also be like him.<br>
[5] Answer a fool according to his folly,<br>
lest he be wise in his own opinion.<br>
[6] Like cutting off the feet or drinking violence,<br>
so is sending a message by the hand of a fool.<br>
[7] Like legs dangle uselessly from the lame,<br>
so a proverb dangles in the mouth of fools.<br>
[8] Like tying a stone in a sling,<br>
so is giving honor to a fool.<br>
[9] Like a thorn has gone up into the hand of a drunkard,<br>
so a proverb has gone up into the mouth of a fool.<br>
[10] Like an archer who wounds at random,<br>
so is the one who hires a fool or hires any passerby.<br>
[11] Like a dog that returns to its vomit,<br>
so a fool repeats his folly.<br>
[12] You have seen a man wise in his own opinion —<br>
there is more hope for a fool than for him.<br>
[13] The sluggard has said, “There is a lion in the road!<br>
A lion in the streets!”<br>
[14] Like a door that turns on its hinges,<br>
so a sluggard turns on his bed.<br>
[15] The sluggard has plunged his hand in the dish;<br>
he is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.<br>
[16] The sluggard is wiser in his own opinion<br>
than seven people who respond with good sense.<br>
[17] Like one who grabs a wild dog by the ears,<br>
so is the person passing by who becomes furious over a quarrel not his own.<br>
[18] Like a madman who shoots<br>
firebrands and deadly arrows,<br>
[19] so is a person who has deceived his neighbor,<br>
and said, “Was I not only joking?”<br>
[20] Where there is no wood, a fire goes out,<br>
and where there is no gossip, contention ceases.<br>
[21] Like charcoal is to burning coals, and wood to fire,<br>
so is a contentious person to kindle strife.<br>
[22] The words of a gossip are like choice morsels;<br>
and they have gone down into a person’s innermost being.<br>
[23] Like a coating of glaze over earthenware<br>
are fervent lips with an evil heart.<br>
[24] The one who hates others disguises it with his lips,<br>
but he stores up deceit within him.<br>
[25] When he speaks graciously, do not believe him,<br>
for there are seven abominations within him.<br>
[26] Though his hatred may be concealed by deceit,<br>
his evil will be uncovered in the assembly.<br>
[27] The one who digs a pit will fall into it;<br>
the one who rolls a stone—it will come back on him.<br>
[28] A lying tongue hates those crushed by it,<br>
and a flattering mouth works ruin.<br>
## Chapter 27

[1] Do not boast about tomorrow;<br>
for you do not know what a day may bring forth.<br>
[2] Let another praise you, and not your own mouth;<br>
someone else, and not your own lips.<br>
[3] A stone is heavy and sand is weighty,<br>
but vexation by a fool is more burdensome than the two of them.<br>
[4] Wrath is cruel and anger is overwhelming,<br>
but who can stand before jealousy?<br>
[5] Better is open rebuke<br>
than hidden love.<br>
[6] Faithful are the wounds of a friend,<br>
but the kisses of an enemy are excessive.<br>
[7] The one whose appetite is satisfied loathes honey,<br>
but to the hungry mouth every bitter thing is sweet.<br>
[8] Like a bird that wanders from its nest,<br>
so is a person who wanders from his home.<br>
[9] Ointment and incense make the heart rejoice,<br>
likewise the sweetness of one’s friend from sincere counsel.<br>
[10] Do not forsake your friend and your father’s friend,<br>
and do not enter your brother’s house in the day of your disaster;<br>
a neighbor nearby is better than a brother far away.<br>
[11] Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad,<br>
so that I may answer anyone who taunts me.<br>
[12] A shrewd person saw danger—he hid himself;<br>
the naive passed right on by — they had to pay for it.<br>
[13] Take a man’s garment when he has given security for a stranger,<br>
and hold him in pledge on behalf of a stranger.<br>
[14] If someone blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning,<br>
it will be counted as a curse to him.<br>
[15] A continual dripping on a rainy day—<br>
a contentious wife makes herself like that.<br>
[16] Whoever contains her has contained the wind<br>
or can grasp oil with his right hand.<br>
[17] As iron sharpens iron,<br>
so a person sharpens his friend.<br>
[18] The one who tends a fig tree will eat its fruit,<br>
and whoever takes care of his master will be honored.<br>
[19] As in water the face is reflected as a face,<br>
so a person’s heart reflects the person.<br>
[20] As Death and Destruction are never satisfied,<br>
so the eyes of a person are never satisfied.<br>
[21] As the crucible is for silver and the furnace is for gold,<br>
so a person must put his praise to the test.<br>
[22] If you should pound the fool in the mortar<br>
among the grain with the pestle,<br>
his foolishness would not depart from him.<br>
[23] Pay careful attention to the condition of your flocks,<br>
set your mind on your herds,<br>
[24] for riches do not last forever,<br>
nor does a crown last from generation to generation.<br>
[25] When the hay is removed and new grass appears,<br>
and the grass from the hills is gathered in,<br>
[26] the lambs will be for your clothing,<br>
and the goats will be for the price of a field.<br>
[27] And there will be enough goat’s milk for your food,<br>
for the food of your household,<br>
and for the sustenance of your servant girls.<br>
## Chapter 28

[1] The wicked person fled, though no one was pursuing,<br>
but the righteous person can be as confident as a lion.<br>
[2] When a country is rebellious it has many princes,<br>
but by someone who is discerning and knowledgeable order is maintained.<br>
[3] A poor person who oppresses the weak<br>
is like a driving rain without food.<br>
[4] Those who forsake the law praise the wicked,<br>
but those who keep the law contend with them.<br>
[5] Evil people do not understand justice,<br>
but those who seek the **Lord** understand it all.<br>
[6] A poor person who walks in his integrity is better<br>
than one who is perverse in his ways even though he is rich.<br>
[7] The one who keeps the law is a discerning child,<br>
but a companion of gluttons brings shame to his parents.<br>
[8] The one who increases his wealth by increasing interest<br>
gathers it for someone who is gracious to the needy.<br>
[9] The one who turns away his ear from hearing the law,<br>
even his prayer is an abomination.<br>
[10] The one who leads the upright astray in an evil way<br>
will himself fall into his own pit,<br>
but the blameless will inherit what is good.<br>
[11] A rich person is wise in his own opinion,<br>
but a discerning poor person can evaluate him properly.<br>
[12] When the righteous rejoice, great is the glory,<br>
but when the wicked rise to power, people are sought out.<br>
[13] The one who covers his transgressions will not prosper,<br>
but whoever confesses them and forsakes them will find mercy.<br>
[14] Blessed is the one who is always cautious,<br>
but whoever hardens his heart will fall into evil.<br>
[15] Like a roaring lion or a roving bear,<br>
so is a wicked ruler over a poor people.<br>
[16] The prince who is a great oppressor lacks wisdom,<br>
but the one who hates unjust gain will prolong his days.<br>
[17] The one who is tormented by the murder of another will flee to the pit;<br>
let no one support him.<br>
[18] The one who walks blamelessly will be delivered,<br>
but whoever is perverse in his ways will fall at once.<br>
[19] The one who works his land will be satisfied with food,<br>
but whoever chases daydreams will have his fill of poverty.<br>
[20] A faithful person will have an abundance of blessings,<br>
but the one who hastens to gain riches will not go unpunished.<br>
[21] To show partiality is terrible,<br>
for a person will transgress over the smallest piece of bread.<br>
[22] The stingy person hastens after riches<br>
and does not know that poverty will overtake him.<br>
[23] The one who reproves another will in the end find more favor<br>
than the one who flatters with the tongue.<br>
[24] The one who robs his father and mother and says, “There is no transgression,”<br>
is a companion to the one who destroys.<br>
[25] The greedy person stirs up dissension,<br>
but the one who trusts in the **Lord** will prosper.<br>
[26] The one who trusts in his own heart is a fool,<br>
but the one who walks in wisdom will escape.<br>
[27] The one who gives to the poor will not lack,<br>
but whoever shuts his eyes to them will receive many curses.<br>
[28] When the wicked gain control, people hide themselves,<br>
but when they perish, the righteous increase.<br>
## Chapter 29

[1] The one who stiffens his neck after numerous rebukes<br>
will suddenly be destroyed without remedy.<br>
[2] When the righteous become numerous, the people rejoice;<br>
when the wicked rule, the people groan.<br>
[3] The man who loves wisdom brings joy to his father,<br>
but whoever associates with prostitutes wastes his wealth.<br>
[4] A king brings stability to a land by justice,<br>
but one who exacts tribute tears it down.<br>
[5] The one who flatters his neighbor<br>
spreads a net for his steps.<br>
[6] In the transgression of an evil person there is a snare,<br>
but a righteous person can sing and rejoice.<br>
[7] The righteous person cares for the legal rights of the poor;<br>
the wicked person does not understand such knowledge.<br>
[8] Scornful people inflame a city,<br>
but those who are wise turn away wrath.<br>
[9] When a wise person goes to court with a foolish person,<br>
there is no peace whether he is angry or laughs.<br>
[10] Bloodthirsty people hate someone with integrity;<br>
as for the upright, they seek his life.<br>
[11] A fool lets fly with all his temper,<br>
but a wise person keeps it back.<br>
[12] If a ruler listens to lies,<br>
all his ministers will be wicked.<br>
[13] The poor person and the oppressor have this in common:<br>
the **Lord** gives light to the eyes of them both.<br>
[14] If a king judges the poor in truth,<br>
his throne will be established forever.<br>
[15] A rod and reproof impart wisdom,<br>
but a child who is unrestrained brings shame to his mother.<br>
[16] When the wicked increase, transgression increases,<br>
but the righteous will see their downfall.<br>
[17] Discipline your child, and he will give you rest;<br>
he will bring you happiness.<br>
[18] When there is no prophetic vision the people cast off restraint,<br>
but the one who keeps the law, blessed is he!<br>
[19] A servant cannot be corrected by words,<br>
for although he understands, there is no answer.<br>
[20] You have seen someone who is hasty in his words —<br>
there is more hope for a fool than for him.<br>
[21] If someone pampers his servant from youth,<br>
he will be a weakling in the end.<br>
[22] An angry person stirs up dissension,<br>
and a wrathful person is abounding in transgression.<br>
[23] A person’s pride will bring him low,<br>
but one who has a lowly spirit will gain honor.<br>
[24] Whoever shares with a thief is his own enemy;<br>
he hears the oath to testify, but does not talk.<br>
[25] The fear of people becomes a snare,<br>
but whoever trusts in the **Lord** will be set on high.<br>
[26] Many people seek the face of a ruler,<br>
but it is from the **Lord** that one receives justice.<br>
[27] An unjust person is an abomination to the righteous,<br>
and the one who lives an upright life is an abomination to the wicked.<br>
## Chapter 30

### The Words of Agur

[1] The words of Agur, the son of Jakeh; an oracle:<br>
This man says to Ithiel, to Ithiel and to Ukal:<br>
[2] Surely I am more brutish than any other human being,<br>
and I do not have human understanding;<br>
[3] I have not learned wisdom,<br>
nor can I have knowledge of the Holy One.<br>
[4] Who has ascended into heaven, and then descended?<br>
Who has gathered up the winds in his fists?<br>
Who has bound up the waters in his cloak?<br>
Who has established all the ends of the earth?<br>
What is his name, and what is his son’s name? Surely you can know!<br>
[5] Every word of God is purified;<br>
he is like a shield for those who take refuge in him.<br>
[6] Do not add to his words,<br>
lest he reprove you, and prove you to be a liar.<br>
[7] Two things I have asked from you;<br>
do not refuse me before I die:<br>
[8] Remove falsehood and lies far from me;<br>
do not give me poverty or riches,<br>
feed me with my allotted portion of bread,<br>
[9] lest I become satisfied and act deceptively<br>
and say, “Who is the **Lord**?”<br>
Or lest I become poor and steal<br>
and demean the name of my God.<br>
[10] Do not slander a servant to his master,<br>
lest he curse you, and you are found guilty.<br>
[11] There is a generation who curse their fathers<br>
and do not bless their mothers.<br>
[12] There is a generation who are pure in their own opinion<br>
and yet are not washed from their filthiness.<br>
[13] There is a generation whose eyes are so lofty,<br>
and whose eyelids are lifted up disdainfully.<br>
[14] There is a generation whose teeth are like swords<br>
and whose molars are like knives<br>
to devour the poor from the earth<br>
and the needy from among the human race.<br>
[15] The leech has two daughters:<br>
“Give! Give!”<br>
There are three things that will never be satisfied,<br>
four that have never said, “Enough” —<br>
[16] the grave, the barren womb;<br>
earth has not been satisfied with water;<br>
and fire has never said, “Enough!”<br>
[17] The eye that mocks at a father<br>
and despises obeying a mother—<br>
the ravens of the valley will peck it out<br>
and the young vultures will eat it.<br>
[18] There are three things that are too wonderful for me,<br>
four that I do not understand:<br>
[19] the way of an eagle in the sky,<br>
the way of a snake on a rock,<br>
the way of a ship in the sea,<br>
and the way of a man with a woman.<br>
[20] This is the way of an adulterous woman:<br>
she has eaten and wiped her mouth<br>
and has said, “I have not done wrong.”<br>
[21] Under three things the earth has trembled,<br>
and under four things it cannot bear up:<br>
[22] under a servant who becomes king,<br>
under a fool who becomes stuffed with food,<br>
[23] under an unloved woman who becomes married,<br>
and under a female servant who dispossesses her mistress.<br>
[24] There are four things on earth that are small,<br>
but they are exceedingly wise:<br>
[25] ants are creatures with little strength,<br>
but they prepare their food in the summer;<br>
[26] rock badgers are creatures with little power,<br>
but they make their homes in the crags;<br>
[27] locusts have no king,<br>
but they all go forward by ranks;<br>
[28] a lizard you can catch with the hand,<br>
but it gets into the palaces of the king.<br>
[29] There are three things that are magnificent in their step,<br>
four things that move about magnificently:<br>
[30] a lion, mightiest of the beasts,<br>
who does not retreat from anything;<br>
[31] a strutting rooster, a male goat,<br>
and a king with his army around him.<br>
[32] If you have done foolishly by exalting yourself<br>
or if you have planned evil,<br>
put your hand over your mouth!<br>
[33] For as the churning of milk produces butter<br>
and as punching the nose produces blood,<br>
so stirring up anger produces strife.<br>
## Chapter 31

### The Words of Lemuel

[1] The words of King Lemuel, an oracle that his mother taught him:

[2] O my son, O son of my womb,<br>
O son of my vows,<br>
[3] do not give your strength to women,<br>
nor your ways to that which ruins kings.<br>
[4] It is not for kings, O Lemuel,<br>
it is not for kings to drink wine,<br>
or for rulers to crave strong drink,<br>
[5] lest they drink and forget what is decreed,<br>
and remove from all the poor their legal rights.<br>
[6] Give strong drink to the one who is perishing,<br>
and wine to those who are bitterly distressed;<br>
[7] let them drink and forget their poverty,<br>
and remember their misery no more.<br>
[8] Open your mouth on behalf of those unable to speak,<br>
for the legal rights of all the dying.<br>
[9] Open your mouth, judge in righteousness,<br>
and plead the cause of the poor and needy.<br>

### The Wife of Noble Character

[10] Who can find a wife of noble character?<br>
For her value is far more than rubies.<br>
[11] Her husband’s heart has trusted her,<br>
and he does not lack the dividends.<br>
[12] She has rewarded him with good and not harm<br>
all the days of her life.<br>
[13] She sought out wool and flax,<br>
then worked happily with her hands.<br>
[14] She was like the merchant ships;<br>
she would bring in her food from afar.<br>
[15] Then she rose while it was still night,<br>
and provided food for her household and a portion to her female servants.<br>
[16] She considered a field and bought it;<br>
from her own income she planted a vineyard.<br>
[17] She clothed herself in might,<br>
and she strengthened her arms.<br>
[18] She perceived that her merchandise was good.<br>
Her lamp would not go out in the night.<br>
[19] She extended her hands to the spool,<br>
and her hands grasped the spindle.<br>
[20] She opened her hand to the poor,<br>
and extended her hands to the needy.<br>
[21] She would not fear for her household in winter,<br>
because all her household were clothed with scarlet,<br>
[22] because she had made coverings for herself;<br>
and because her clothing was fine linen and purple.<br>
[23] Her husband is well-known in the city gate<br>
when he sits with the elders of the land.<br>
[24] She made linen garments then sold them,<br>
and traded belts to the merchants;<br>
[25] her clothing was strong and splendid;<br>
and she laughed at the time to come.<br>
[26] She has opened her mouth with wisdom,<br>
with loving instruction on her tongue.<br>
[27] Watching over the ways of her household,<br>
she would not eat the bread of idleness.<br>
[28] Her children have risen and called her blessed;<br>
her husband also has praised her:<br>
[29] “Many daughters have done valiantly,<br>
but you have surpassed them all!”<br>
[30] Charm is deceitful and beauty is fleeting.<br>
A woman who fears the **Lord** —she makes herself praiseworthy.<br>
[31] Give her credit for what she has accomplished,<br>
and let her works praise her in the city gates.<br>
