# Psalms

## Psalm 1

### Book 1(Psalms 1-41)

[1] How blessed is the one who does not follow the advice of the wicked,<br>
or stand in the pathway with sinners,<br>
or sit in the assembly of scoffers.<br>
[2] Instead he finds pleasure in obeying the **Lord**’s commands;<br>
he meditates on his commands day and night.<br>
[3] He is like a tree planted by flowing streams;<br>
it yields its fruit at the proper time,<br>
and its leaves never fall off.<br>
He succeeds in everything he attempts.<br>
[4] Not so with the wicked!<br>
Instead they are like wind-driven chaff.<br>
[5] For this reason the wicked cannot withstand judgment,<br>
nor can sinners join the assembly of the godly.<br>
[6] Certainly the **Lord** guards the way of the godly,<br>
but the way of the wicked ends in destruction.<br>
## Psalm 2

[1] Why do the nations rebel?<br>
Why are the countries devising plots that will fail?<br>
[2] The kings of the earth form a united front;<br>
the rulers collaborate<br>
against the **Lord** and his anointed king.<br>
[3] They say, “Let’s tear off the shackles they’ve put on us.<br>
Let’s free ourselves from their ropes.”<br>
[4] The one enthroned in heaven laughs in disgust;<br>
the Lord taunts them.<br>
[5] Then he angrily speaks to them<br>
and terrifies them in his rage, saying,<br>
[6] “I myself have installed my king<br>
on Zion, my holy hill.”<br>
[7] The king says, “I will announce the **Lord**’s decree. He said to me:<br>
‘You are my son. This very day I have become your father.<br>
[8] Ask me,<br>
and I will give you the nations as your inheritance,<br>
the ends of the earth as your personal property.<br>
[9] You will break them with an iron scepter;<br>
you will smash them like a potter’s jar.’”<br>
[10] So now, you kings, do what is wise;<br>
you rulers of the earth, submit to correction.<br>
[11] Serve the **Lord** in fear.<br>
Repent in terror.<br>
[12] Give sincere homage.<br>
Otherwise he will be angry,<br>
and you will die because of your behavior,<br>
when his anger quickly ignites.<br>
How blessed are all who take shelter in him!<br>
## Psalm 3

[1] **Lord**, how numerous are my enemies!<br>
Many attack me.<br>
[2] Many say about me,<br>
“God will not deliver him.” (Selah)<br>
[3] But you, **Lord**, are a shield that protects me;<br>
you are my glory and the one who restores me.<br>
[4] To the **Lord** I cried out,<br>
and he answered me from his holy hill. (Selah)<br>
[5] I rested and slept;<br>
I awoke, for the **Lord** protects me.<br>
[6] I am not afraid of the multitude of people<br>
who attack me from all directions.<br>
[7] Rise up, **Lord**!<br>
Deliver me, my God!<br>
Yes, you will strike all my enemies on the jaw;<br>
you will break the teeth of the wicked.<br>
[8] The **Lord** delivers;<br>
you show favor to your people. (Selah)<br>
## Psalm 4

[1] When I call out, answer me,<br>
O God who vindicates me.<br>
Though I am hemmed in, you will lead me into a wide, open place.<br>
Have mercy on me and respond to my prayer.<br>
[2] You men, how long will you try to turn my honor into shame?<br>
How long will you love what is worthless<br>
and search for what is deceptive? (Selah)<br>
[3] Realize that the **Lord** shows the godly special favor;<br>
the **Lord** responds when I cry out to him.<br>
[4] Tremble with fear and do not sin.<br>
Meditate as you lie in bed, and repent of your ways. (Selah)<br>
[5] Offer the prescribed sacrifices<br>
and trust in the **Lord**.<br>
[6] Many say, “Who can show us anything good?”<br>
Smile upon us, **Lord**!<br>
[7] You make me happier<br>
than those who have abundant grain and wine.<br>
[8] I will lie down and sleep peacefully,<br>
for you, **Lord**, make me safe and secure.<br>
## Psalm 5

[1] Listen to what I say, **Lord**!<br>
Carefully consider my complaint!<br>
[2] Pay attention to my cry for help,<br>
my King and my God,<br>
for I am praying to you!<br>
[3] **Lord**, in the morning you will hear me;<br>
in the morning I will present my case to you and then wait expectantly for an answer.<br>
[4] Certainly you are not a God who approves of evil;<br>
evil people cannot dwell with you.<br>
[5] Arrogant people cannot stand in your presence;<br>
you hate all who behave wickedly.<br>
[6] You destroy liars;<br>
the **Lord** despises violent and deceitful people.<br>
[7] But as for me, because of your great faithfulness I will enter your house;<br>
I will bow down toward your holy temple as I worship you.<br>
[8] **Lord**, lead me in your righteousness<br>
because of those who wait to ambush me,<br>
remove the obstacles in the way in which you are guiding me.<br>
[9] For they do not speak the truth;<br>
their stomachs are like the place of destruction,<br>
their throats like an open grave,<br>
their tongues like a steep slope leading into it.<br>
[10] Condemn them, O God!<br>
May their own schemes be their downfall.<br>
Drive them away because of their many acts of insurrection,<br>
for they have rebelled against you.<br>
[11] But may all who take shelter in you be happy.<br>
May they continually shout for joy.<br>
Shelter them so that those who are loyal to you may rejoice.<br>
[12] Certainly you reward the godly, **Lord**.<br>
Like a shield you protect them in your good favor.<br>
## Psalm 6

[1] **Lord**, do not rebuke me in your anger.<br>
Do not discipline me in your raging fury.<br>
[2] Have mercy on me, **Lord**, for I am frail.<br>
Heal me, **Lord**, for my bones are shaking.<br>
[3] I am absolutely terrified,<br>
and you, **Lord**—how long will this continue?<br>
[4] Relent, **Lord**, rescue me!<br>
Deliver me because of your faithfulness.<br>
[5] For no one remembers you in the realm of death.<br>
In Sheol who gives you thanks?<br>
[6] I am exhausted as I groan.<br>
All night long I drench my bed in tears;<br>
my tears saturate the cushion beneath me.<br>
[7] My eyes grow dim from suffering;<br>
they grow weak because of all my enemies.<br>
[8] Turn back from me, all you who behave wickedly,<br>
for the **Lord** has heard the sound of my weeping.<br>
[9] The **Lord** has heard my appeal for mercy;<br>
the **Lord** has accepted my prayer.<br>
[10] They will be humiliated and absolutely terrified.<br>
All my enemies will turn back and be suddenly humiliated.<br>
## Psalm 7

[1] O **Lord** my God, in you I have taken shelter.<br>
Deliver me from all who chase me. Rescue me!<br>
[2] Otherwise they will rip me to shreds like a lion;<br>
they will tear me to bits and no one will be able to rescue me.<br>
[3] O **Lord** my God, if I have done what they say,<br>
or am guilty of unjust actions,<br>
[4] or have wronged my ally,<br>
or helped his lawless enemy,<br>
[5] may an enemy relentlessly chase me and catch me;<br>
may he trample me to death<br>
and leave me lying dishonored in the dust. (Selah)<br>
[6] Stand up angrily, **Lord**.<br>
Rise up with raging fury against my enemies.<br>
Wake up for my sake, and execute the judgment you have decreed for them.<br>
[7] The countries are assembled all around you;<br>
take once more your rightful place over them.<br>
[8] The **Lord** judges the nations.<br>
Vindicate me, **Lord**, because I am innocent,<br>
because I am blameless, O Exalted One.<br>
[9] May the evil deeds of the wicked come to an end.<br>
But make the innocent secure,<br>
O righteous God,<br>
you who examine inner thoughts and motives.<br>
[10] The Exalted God is my shield,<br>
the one who delivers the morally upright.<br>
[11] God is a just judge;<br>
he is angry throughout the day.<br>
[12] If a person does not repent, God will wield his sword.<br>
He has prepared to shoot his bow.<br>
[13] He has prepared deadly weapons to use against him;<br>
he gets ready to shoot flaming arrows.<br>
[14] See the one who is pregnant with wickedness,<br>
who conceives destructive plans,<br>
and gives birth to harmful lies—<br>
[15] he digs a pit<br>
and then falls into the hole he has made.<br>
[16] He becomes the victim of his own destructive plans —<br>
and the violence he intended for others falls on his own head.<br>
[17] I will thank the **Lord** for his justice;<br>
I will sing praises to the **Lord** Most High!<br>
## Psalm 8

[1] O **Lord**, our Lord,<br>
how magnificent is your reputation throughout the earth!<br>
You reveal your majesty in the heavens above.<br>
[2] From the mouths of children and nursing babies<br>
you have ordained praise on account of your adversaries,<br>
so that you might put an end to the vindictive enemy.<br>
[3] When I look up at the heavens, which your fingers made,<br>
and see the moon and the stars, which you set in place,<br>
[4] Of what importance is the human race, that you should notice them?<br>
Of what importance is mankind, that you should pay attention to them?<br>
[5] You made them a little less than the heavenly beings.<br>
You crowned mankind with honor and majesty.<br>
[6] you appoint them to rule over your creation;<br>
you have placed everything under their authority,<br>
[7] including all the sheep and cattle,<br>
as well as the wild animals,<br>
[8] the birds in the sky, the fish in the sea,<br>
and everything that moves through the currents of the seas.<br>
[9] O **Lord**, our Lord,<br>
how magnificent is your reputation throughout the earth!<br>
## Psalm 9

[1] I will thank the **Lord** with all my heart!<br>
I will tell about all your amazing deeds.<br>
[2] I will be happy and rejoice in you.<br>
I will sing praises to you, O Most High.<br>
[3] When my enemies turn back,<br>
they trip and are defeated before you.<br>
[4] For you defended my just cause;<br>
from your throne you pronounced a just decision.<br>
[5] You terrified the nations with your battle cry.<br>
You destroyed the wicked;<br>
you permanently wiped out all memory of them.<br>
[6] The enemy’s cities have been reduced to permanent ruins.<br>
You destroyed their cities;<br>
all memory of the enemies has perished.<br>
[7] But the **Lord** rules forever;<br>
he reigns in a just manner.<br>
[8] He judges the world fairly;<br>
he makes just legal decisions for the nations.<br>
[9] Consequently the **Lord** provides safety for the oppressed;<br>
he provides safety in times of trouble.<br>
[10] Your loyal followers trust in you,<br>
for you, **Lord**, do not abandon those who seek your help.<br>
[11] Sing praises to the **Lord**, who rules in Zion.<br>
Tell the nations what he has done.<br>
[12] For the one who takes revenge against murderers took notice of the oppressed;<br>
he did not overlook their cry for help<br>
[13] when they prayed:<br>
“Have mercy on me, **Lord**!<br>
See how I am oppressed by those who hate me,<br>
O one who can snatch me away from the gates of death!<br>
[14] Then I will tell about all your praiseworthy acts;<br>
in the gates of Daughter Zion I will rejoice because of your deliverance.”<br>
[15] The nations fell into the pit they had made;<br>
their feet were caught in the net they had hidden.<br>
[16] The **Lord** revealed himself;<br>
he accomplished justice.<br>
The wicked were ensnared by their own actions. (_Higgaion_. _Selah_)<br>
[17] The wicked are turned back and sent to Sheol;<br>
this is the destiny of all the nations that ignore God,<br>
[18] for the needy are not permanently ignored,<br>
the hopes of the oppressed are not forever dashed.<br>
[19] Rise up, **Lord**!<br>
Don’t let men be defiant.<br>
May the nations be judged in your presence.<br>
[20] Terrify them, **Lord**.<br>
Let the nations know they are mere mortals. (Selah)<br>
## Psalm 10

[1] Why, **Lord**, do you stand far off?<br>
Why do you pay no attention during times of trouble?<br>
[2] The wicked arrogantly chase the oppressed;<br>
the oppressed are trapped by the schemes the wicked have dreamed up.<br>
[3] Yes, the wicked man boasts because he gets what he wants;<br>
the one who robs others curses and rejects the **Lord**.<br>
[4] The wicked man is so arrogant he always thinks,<br>
“God won’t hold me accountable; he doesn’t care.”<br>
[5] He is secure at all times.<br>
He has no regard for your commands;<br>
he disdains all his enemies.<br>
[6] He says to himself,<br>
“I will never be shaken,<br>
because I experience no calamity.”<br>
[7] His mouth is full of curses and deceptive, harmful words;<br>
his tongue injures and destroys.<br>
[8] He waits in ambush near the villages;<br>
in hidden places he kills the innocent.<br>
His eyes look for some unfortunate victim.<br>
[9] He lies in ambush in a hidden place, like a lion in a thicket.<br>
He lies in ambush, waiting to catch the oppressed;<br>
he catches the oppressed by pulling in his net.<br>
[10] His victims are crushed and beaten down;<br>
they are trapped in his sturdy nets.<br>
[11] He says to himself,<br>
“God overlooks it;<br>
he does not pay attention;<br>
he never notices.”<br>
[12] Rise up, **Lord**!<br>
O God, strike him down.<br>
Do not forget the oppressed.<br>
[13] Why does the wicked man reject God?<br>
He says to himself, “You will not hold me accountable.”<br>
[14] You have taken notice,<br>
for you always see one who inflicts pain and suffering.<br>
The unfortunate victim entrusts his cause to you;<br>
you deliver the fatherless.<br>
[15] Break the arm of the wicked and evil man.<br>
Hold him accountable for his wicked deeds,<br>
which he thought you would not discover.<br>
[16] The **Lord** rules forever!<br>
The nations are driven out of his land.<br>
[17] **Lord**, you have heard the request of the oppressed;<br>
you make them feel secure because you listen to their prayer.<br>
[18] You defend the fatherless and oppressed,<br>
so that mere mortals may no longer terrorize them.<br>
## Psalm 11

[1] In the **Lord** I have taken shelter.<br>
How can you say to me,<br>
“Flee to a mountain like a bird.<br>
[2] For look, the wicked prepare their bows,<br>
they put their arrows on the strings,<br>
to shoot in the darkness at the morally upright.<br>
[3] When the foundations are destroyed,<br>
what can the godly accomplish?”<br>
[4] The **Lord** is in his holy temple;<br>
the **Lord**’s throne is in heaven.<br>
His eyes watch;<br>
his eyes examine all people.<br>
[5] The **Lord** approves of the godly,<br>
but he hates the wicked and those who love to do violence.<br>
[6] May he rain down burning coals and brimstone on the wicked!<br>
A whirlwind is what they deserve.<br>
[7] Certainly the **Lord** is just;<br>
he rewards godly deeds.<br>
The upright will experience his favor.<br>
## Psalm 12

[1] Deliver, **Lord**!<br>
For the godly have disappeared;<br>
people of integrity have vanished.<br>
[2] People lie to one another;<br>
they flatter and deceive.<br>
[3] May the **Lord** cut off all flattering lips,<br>
and the tongue that boasts!<br>
[4] They say, “We speak persuasively;<br>
we know how to flatter and boast.<br>
Who is our master?”<br>
[5] “Because of the violence done to the oppressed,<br>
because of the painful cries of the needy,<br>
I will spring into action,” says the **Lord**.<br>
“I will provide the safety they so desperately desire.”<br>
[6] The **Lord**’s words are absolutely reliable.<br>
They are as untainted as silver purified in a furnace on the ground,<br>
where it is thoroughly refined.<br>
[7] You, **Lord**, will protect them;<br>
you will continually shelter each one from these evil people,<br>
[8] for the wicked seem to be everywhere,<br>
when people promote evil.<br>
## Psalm 13

[1] How long, **Lord**, will you continue to ignore me?<br>
How long will you pay no attention to me?<br>
[2] How long must I worry,<br>
and suffer in broad daylight?<br>
How long will my enemy gloat over me?<br>
[3] Look at me! Answer me, O **Lord** my God!<br>
Revive me, or else I will die.<br>
[4] Then my enemy will say, “I have defeated him.”<br>
Then my foes will rejoice because I am shaken.<br>
[5] But I trust in your faithfulness.<br>
May I rejoice because of your deliverance.<br>
[6] I will sing praises to the **Lord**<br>
when he vindicates me.<br>
## Psalm 14

[1] Fools say to themselves, “There is no God.”<br>
They sin and commit evil deeds;<br>
none of them does what is right.<br>
[2] The **Lord** looks down from heaven at the human race,<br>
to see if there is anyone who is wise and seeks God.<br>
[3] Everyone rejects God;<br>
they are all morally corrupt.<br>
None of them does what is right,<br>
not even one.<br>
[4] All those who behave wickedly do not understand—<br>
those who devour my people as if they were eating bread,<br>
and do not call out to the **Lord**.<br>
[5] They are absolutely terrified,<br>
for God defends the godly.<br>
[6] You want to humiliate the oppressed,<br>
even though the **Lord** is their shelter.<br>
[7] I wish the deliverance of Israel would come from Zion!<br>
When the **Lord** restores the well-being of his people,<br>
may Jacob rejoice,<br>
may Israel be happy!<br>
## Psalm 15

[1] **Lord**, who may be a guest in your home?<br>
Who may live on your holy hill?<br>
[2] Whoever lives a blameless life,<br>
does what is right,<br>
and speaks honestly.<br>
[3] He does not slander,<br>
or do harm to others,<br>
or insult his neighbor.<br>
[4] He despises a reprobate,<br>
but honors the **Lord**’s loyal followers.<br>
He makes firm commitments and does not renege on his promise.<br>
[5] He does not charge interest when he lends his money.<br>
He does not take bribes to testify against the innocent.<br>
The one who lives like this will never be shaken.<br>
## Psalm 16

[1] Protect me, O God, for I have taken shelter in you.<br>
[2] I say to the **Lord**, “You are the Lord,<br>
my only source of well-being.”<br>
[3] As for God’s chosen people who are in the land,<br>
and the leading officials I admired so much —<br>
[4] their troubles multiply;<br>
they desire other gods.<br>
I will not pour out drink offerings of blood to their gods,<br>
nor will I make vows in the name of their gods.<br>
[5] **Lord**, you give me stability and prosperity;<br>
you make my future secure.<br>
[6] It is as if I have been given fertile fields<br>
or received a beautiful tract of land.<br>
[7] I will praise the **Lord** who guides me;<br>
yes, during the night I reflect and learn.<br>
[8] I constantly trust in the **Lord**;<br>
because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.<br>
[9] So my heart rejoices<br>
and I am happy;<br>
my life is safe.<br>
[10] You will not abandon me to Sheol;<br>
you will not allow your faithful follower to see the Pit.<br>
[11] You lead me in the path of life.<br>
I experience absolute joy in your presence;<br>
you always give me sheer delight.<br>
## Psalm 17

[1] **Lord**, consider my just cause.<br>
Pay attention to my cry for help.<br>
Listen to the prayer<br>
I sincerely offer.<br>
[2] Make a just decision on my behalf.<br>
Decide what is right.<br>
[3] You have scrutinized my inner motives;<br>
you have examined me during the night.<br>
You have carefully evaluated me, but you find no sin.<br>
I am determined I will say nothing sinful.<br>
[4] As for the actions of people —<br>
just as you have commanded,<br>
I have not followed in the footsteps of violent men.<br>
[5] I carefully obey your commands;<br>
I do not deviate from them.<br>
[6] I call to you because you will answer me, O God.<br>
Listen to me!<br>
Hear what I say!<br>
[7] Accomplish awesome, faithful deeds,<br>
you who powerfully deliver those who look to you for protection from their enemies.<br>
[8] Protect me as you would protect the pupil of your eye.<br>
Hide me in the shadow of your wings.<br>
[9] Protect me from the wicked men who attack me,<br>
my enemies who crowd around me for the kill.<br>
[10] They are calloused;<br>
they speak arrogantly.<br>
[11] They attack me, now they surround me;<br>
they intend to throw me to the ground.<br>
[12] He is like a lion that wants to tear its prey to bits,<br>
like a young lion crouching in hidden places.<br>
[13] Rise up, **Lord**!<br>
Confront him. Knock him down.<br>
Use your sword to rescue me from the wicked man.<br>
[14] **Lord**, use your power to deliver me from these murderers,<br>
from the murderers of this world.<br>
They enjoy prosperity;<br>
you overwhelm them with the riches they desire.<br>
They have many children,<br>
and leave their wealth to their offspring.<br>
[15] As for me, because I am innocent I will see your face;<br>
when I awake you will reveal yourself to me.<br>
## Psalm 18

[1] He said:<br>
“I love you, **Lord**, my source of strength!<br>
[2] The **Lord** is my high ridge, my stronghold, my deliverer.<br>
My God is my rocky summit where I take shelter,<br>
my shield, the horn that saves me, and my refuge.<br>
[3] I called to the **Lord**, who is worthy of praise,<br>
and I was delivered from my enemies.<br>
[4] The waves of death engulfed me,<br>
the currents of chaos overwhelmed me.<br>
[5] The ropes of Sheol tightened around me,<br>
the snares of death trapped me.<br>
[6] In my distress I called to the **Lord**;<br>
I cried out to my God.<br>
From his heavenly temple he heard my voice;<br>
he listened to my cry for help.<br>
[7] The earth heaved and shook.<br>
The roots of the mountains trembled;<br>
they heaved because he was angry.<br>
[8] Smoke ascended from his nose;<br>
fire devoured as it came from his mouth.<br>
He hurled down fiery coals.<br>
[9] He made the sky sink as he descended;<br>
a thick cloud was under his feet.<br>
[10] He mounted a winged angel and flew;<br>
he glided on the wings of the wind.<br>
[11] He shrouded himself in darkness,<br>
in thick rain clouds.<br>
[12] From the brightness in front of him came<br>
hail and fiery coals.<br>
[13] The **Lord** thundered in the sky;<br>
the Most High shouted.<br>
[14] He shot his arrows and scattered them,<br>
many lightning bolts and routed them.<br>
[15] The depths of the sea were exposed;<br>
the inner regions of the world were uncovered<br>
by your battle cry, **Lord**,<br>
by the powerful breath from your nose.<br>
[16] He reached down from above and took hold of me;<br>
he pulled me from the surging water.<br>
[17] He rescued me from my strong enemy,<br>
from those who hate me,<br>
for they were too strong for me.<br>
[18] They confronted me in my day of calamity,<br>
but the **Lord** helped me.<br>
[19] He brought me out into a wide open place;<br>
he delivered me because he was pleased with me.<br>
[20] The **Lord** repaid me for my godly deeds;<br>
he rewarded my blameless behavior.<br>
[21] For I have obeyed the **Lord**’s commands;<br>
I have not rebelled against my God.<br>
[22] For I am aware of all his regulations,<br>
and I do not reject his rules.<br>
[23] I was innocent before him,<br>
and kept myself from sinning.<br>
[24] The **Lord** rewarded me for my godly deeds;<br>
he took notice of my blameless behavior.<br>
[25] You prove to be loyal to one who is faithful;<br>
you prove to be trustworthy to one who is innocent.<br>
[26] You prove to be reliable to one who is blameless,<br>
but you prove to be deceptive to one who is perverse.<br>
[27] For you deliver oppressed people,<br>
but you bring down those who have a proud look.<br>
[28] Indeed, you light my lamp, **Lord**.<br>
My God illuminates the darkness around me.<br>
[29] Indeed, with your help I can charge against an army;<br>
by my God’s power I can jump over a wall.<br>
[30] The one true God acts in a faithful manner;<br>
the **Lord**’s promise is reliable.<br>
He is a shield to all who take shelter in him.<br>
[31] Indeed, who is God besides the **Lord**?<br>
Who is a protector besides our God?<br>
[32] The one true God gives me strength;<br>
he removes the obstacles in my way.<br>
[33] He gives me the agility of a deer;<br>
he enables me to negotiate the rugged terrain.<br>
[34] He trains my hands for battle;<br>
my arms can bend even the strongest bow.<br>
[35] You give me your protective shield;<br>
your right hand supports me.<br>
Your willingness to help enables me to prevail.<br>
[36] You widen my path;<br>
my feet do not slip.<br>
[37] I chase my enemies and catch them;<br>
I do not turn back until I wipe them out.<br>
[38] I beat them to death;<br>
they fall at my feet.<br>
[39] You give me strength for battle;<br>
you make my foes kneel before me.<br>
[40] You make my enemies retreat;<br>
I destroy those who hate me.<br>
[41] They cry out, but there is no one to help them;<br>
they cry out to the **Lord**, but he does not answer them.<br>
[42] I grind them as fine windblown dust;<br>
I beat them underfoot like clay in the streets.<br>
[43] You rescue me from a hostile army.<br>
You make me a leader of nations;<br>
people over whom I had no authority are now my subjects.<br>
[44] When they hear of my exploits, they submit to me.<br>
Foreigners are powerless before me.<br>
[45] Foreigners lose their courage;<br>
they shake with fear as they leave their strongholds.<br>
[46] The **Lord** is alive!<br>
My Protector is praiseworthy.<br>
The God who delivers me is exalted as king.<br>
[47] The one true God completely vindicates me;<br>
he makes nations submit to me.<br>
[48] He delivers me from my enemies.<br>
You snatch me away from those who attack me;<br>
you rescue me from violent men.<br>
[49] So I will give you thanks before the nations, O **Lord**.<br>
I will sing praises to you.<br>
[50] He gives his king magnificent victories;<br>
he is faithful to his chosen ruler,<br>
to David and his descendants forever.”<br>
## Psalm 19

[1] The heavens declare the glory of God;<br>
the sky displays his handiwork.<br>
[2] Day after day it speaks out;<br>
night after night it reveals his greatness.<br>
[3] There is no actual speech or word,<br>
nor is its voice literally heard.<br>
[4] Yet its voice echoes throughout the earth;<br>
its words carry to the distant horizon.<br>
In the sky he has pitched a tent for the sun.<br>
[5] Like a bridegroom it emerges from its chamber;<br>
like a strong man it enjoys running its course.<br>
[6] It emerges from the distant horizon,<br>
and goes from one end of the sky to the other;<br>
nothing can escape its heat.<br>
[7] The law of the **Lord** is perfect<br>
and preserves one’s life.<br>
The rules set down by the **Lord** are reliable<br>
and impart wisdom to the inexperienced.<br>
[8] The **Lord**’s precepts are fair<br>
and make one joyful.<br>
The **Lord**’s commands are pure<br>
and give insight for life.<br>
[9] The commands to fear the **Lord** are right<br>
and endure forever.<br>
The judgments given by the **Lord** are trustworthy<br>
and absolutely just.<br>
[10] They are of greater value than gold,<br>
than even a great amount of pure gold;<br>
they bring greater delight than honey,<br>
than even the sweetest honey from a honeycomb.<br>
[11] Yes, your servant finds moral guidance there;<br>
those who obey them receive a rich reward.<br>
[12] Who can know all his errors?<br>
Please do not punish me for sins I am unaware of.<br>
[13] Moreover, keep me from committing flagrant sins;<br>
do not allow such sins to control me.<br>
Then I will be blameless,<br>
and innocent of blatant rebellion.<br>
[14] May my words and my thoughts<br>
be acceptable in your sight,<br>
O **Lord**, my sheltering rock and my redeemer.<br>
## Psalm 20

[1] May the **Lord** answer you when you are in trouble;<br>
may the God of Jacob make you secure.<br>
[2] May he send you help from his temple;<br>
from Zion may he give you support.<br>
[3] May he take notice of all your offerings;<br>
may he accept your burnt sacrifice. (Selah)<br>
[4] May he grant your heart’s desire;<br>
may he bring all your plans to pass.<br>
[5] Then we will shout for joy over your victory;<br>
we will rejoice in the name of our God.<br>
May the **Lord** grant all your requests.<br>
[6] Now I am sure that the **Lord** will deliver his chosen king;<br>
he will intervene for him from his holy, heavenly temple,<br>
and display his mighty ability to deliver.<br>
[7] Some trust in chariots and others in horses,<br>
but we depend on the **Lord** our God.<br>
[8] They will fall down,<br>
but we will stand firm.<br>
[9] The **Lord** will deliver the king;<br>
he will answer us when we call to him for help!<br>
## Psalm 21

[1] O **Lord**, the king rejoices in the strength you give;<br>
he takes great delight in the deliverance you provide.<br>
[2] You grant him his heart’s desire;<br>
you do not refuse his request. (Selah)<br>
[3] For you bring him rich blessings;<br>
you place a golden crown on his head.<br>
[4] He asked you to sustain his life,<br>
and you have granted him long life and an enduring dynasty.<br>
[5] Your deliverance brings him great honor;<br>
you give him majestic splendor.<br>
[6] For you grant him lasting blessings;<br>
you give him great joy by allowing him into your presence.<br>
[7] For the king trusts in the **Lord**,<br>
and because of the Most High’s faithfulness he is not shaken.<br>
[8] You prevail over all your enemies;<br>
your power is too great for those who hate you.<br>
[9] You burn them up like a fiery furnace when you appear.<br>
The **Lord** angrily devours them;<br>
the fire consumes them.<br>
[10] You destroy their offspring from the earth,<br>
their descendants from among the human race.<br>
[11] Yes, they intend to do you harm;<br>
they dream up a scheme, but they do not succeed.<br>
[12] For you make them retreat<br>
when you aim your arrows at them.<br>
[13] Rise up, O **Lord**, in strength!<br>
We will sing and praise your power.<br>
## Psalm 22

[1] My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?<br>
I groan in prayer, but help seems far away.<br>
[2] My God, I cry out during the day,<br>
but you do not answer,<br>
and during the night my prayers do not let up.<br>
[3] You are holy;<br>
you sit as king receiving the praises of Israel.<br>
[4] In you our ancestors trusted;<br>
they trusted in you and you rescued them.<br>
[5] To you they cried out, and they were saved;<br>
in you they trusted and they were not disappointed.<br>
[6] But I am a worm, not a man;<br>
people insult me and despise me.<br>
[7] All who see me taunt me;<br>
they mock me and shake their heads.<br>
[8] They say,<br>
“Commit yourself to the **Lord**!<br>
Let the **Lord** rescue him!<br>
Let the **Lord** deliver him, for he delights in him.”<br>
[9] Yes, you are the one who brought me out from the womb<br>
and made me feel secure on my mother’s breasts.<br>
[10] I have been dependent on you since birth;<br>
from the time I came out of my mother’s womb you have been my God.<br>
[11] Do not remain far away from me,<br>
for trouble is near and I have no one to help me.<br>
[12] Many bulls surround me;<br>
powerful bulls of Bashan hem me in.<br>
[13] They open their mouths to devour me<br>
like a roaring lion that rips its prey.<br>
[14] My strength drains away like water;<br>
all my bones are dislocated.<br>
My heart is like wax;<br>
it melts away inside me.<br>
[15] The roof of my mouth is as dry as a piece of pottery;<br>
my tongue sticks to my gums.<br>
You set me in the dust of death.<br>
[16] Yes, wild dogs surround me—<br>
a gang of evil men crowd around me;<br>
like a lion they pin my hands and feet.<br>
[17] I can count all my bones;<br>
my enemies are gloating over me in triumph.<br>
[18] They are dividing up my clothes among themselves;<br>
they are rolling dice for my garments.<br>
[19] But you, O **Lord**, do not remain far away.<br>
You are my source of strength. Hurry and help me!<br>
[20] Deliver me from the sword.<br>
Save my life from the claws of the wild dogs.<br>
[21] Rescue me from the mouth of the lion,<br>
and from the horns of the wild oxen.<br>
You have answered me.<br>
[22] I will declare your name to my countrymen.<br>
In the middle of the assembly I will praise you.<br>
[23] You loyal followers of the **Lord**, praise him.<br>
All you descendants of Jacob, honor him.<br>
All you descendants of Israel, stand in awe of him.<br>
[24] For he did not despise or detest the suffering of the oppressed.<br>
He did not ignore him;<br>
when he cried out to him, he responded.<br>
[25] You are the reason I offer praise in the great assembly;<br>
I will fulfill my promises before the **Lord**’s loyal followers.<br>
[26] Let the oppressed eat and be filled.<br>
Let those who seek his help praise the **Lord**.<br>
May you live forever!<br>
[27] Let all the people of the earth acknowledge the **Lord** and turn to him.<br>
Let all the nations worship you.<br>
[28] For the **Lord** is king<br>
and rules over the nations.<br>
[29] All the thriving people of the earth will join the celebration and worship;<br>
all those who are descending into the grave will bow before him,<br>
including those who cannot preserve their lives.<br>
[30] A whole generation will serve him;<br>
they will tell the next generation about the Lord.<br>
[31] They will come and tell about his saving deeds;<br>
they will tell a future generation what he has accomplished.<br>
## Psalm 23

[1] The **Lord** is my shepherd,<br>
I lack nothing.<br>
[2] He takes me to lush pastures,<br>
he leads me to refreshing water.<br>
[3] He restores my strength.<br>
He leads me down the right paths<br>
for the sake of his reputation.<br>
[4] Even when I must walk through the darkest valley,<br>
I fear no danger,<br>
for you are with me;<br>
your rod and your staff reassure me.<br>
[5] You prepare a feast before me<br>
in plain sight of my enemies.<br>
You refresh my head with oil;<br>
my cup is completely full.<br>
[6] Surely your goodness and faithfulness will pursue me all my days,<br>
and I will live in the **Lord**’s house for the rest of my life.<br>
## Psalm 24

[1] The **Lord** owns the earth and all it contains,<br>
the world and all who live in it.<br>
[2] For he set its foundation upon the seas,<br>
and established it upon the ocean currents.<br>
[3] Who is allowed to ascend the mountain of the **Lord**?<br>
Who may go up to his holy dwelling place?<br>
[4] The one whose deeds are blameless<br>
and whose motives are pure,<br>
who does not lie,<br>
or make promises with no intention of keeping them.<br>
[5] Such godly people are rewarded by the **Lord**,<br>
and vindicated by the God who delivers them.<br>
[6] Such purity characterizes the people who seek his favor,<br>
Jacob’s descendants, who pray to him. (Selah)<br>
[7] Look up, you gates.<br>
Rise up, you eternal doors.<br>
Then the majestic king will enter.<br>
[8] Who is this majestic king?<br>
The **Lord** who is strong and mighty.<br>
The **Lord** who is mighty in battle.<br>
[9] Look up, you gates.<br>
Rise up, you eternal doors.<br>
Then the majestic king will enter.<br>
[10] Who is this majestic king?<br>
The **Lord** of Heaven’s Armies.<br>
He is the majestic king. (Selah)<br>
## Psalm 25

[1] O **Lord**, I come before you in prayer.<br>
[2] My God, I trust in you.<br>
Please do not let me be humiliated;<br>
do not let my enemies triumphantly rejoice over me.<br>
[3] Certainly none who rely on you will be humiliated.<br>
Those who deal in treachery will be thwarted and humiliated.<br>
[4] Make me understand your ways, O **Lord**.<br>
Teach me your paths.<br>
[5] Guide me into your truth and teach me.<br>
For you are the God who delivers me;<br>
on you I rely all day long.<br>
[6] Remember your compassionate and faithful deeds, O **Lord**,<br>
for you have always acted in this manner.<br>
[7] Do not hold against me the sins of my youth or my rebellious acts.<br>
Because you are faithful to me, extend to me your favor, O **Lord**.<br>
[8] The **Lord** is both kind and fair;<br>
that is why he teaches sinners the right way to live.<br>
[9] May he show the humble what is right.<br>
May he teach the humble his way.<br>
[10] The **Lord** always proves faithful and reliable<br>
to those who follow the demands of his covenant.<br>
[11] For the sake of your reputation, O **Lord**,<br>
forgive my sin, because it is great.<br>
[12] The **Lord** shows his faithful followers<br>
the way they should live.<br>
[13] They experience his favor;<br>
their descendants inherit the land.<br>
[14] The **Lord**’s loyal followers receive his guidance,<br>
and he reveals his covenantal demands to them.<br>
[15] I continually look to the **Lord** for help,<br>
for he will free my feet from the enemy’s net.<br>
[16] Turn toward me and have mercy on me,<br>
for I am alone and oppressed.<br>
[17] Deliver me from my distress;<br>
rescue me from my suffering.<br>
[18] See my pain and suffering.<br>
Forgive all my sins.<br>
[19] Watch my enemies, for they outnumber me;<br>
they hate me and want to harm me.<br>
[20] Protect me and deliver me!<br>
Please do not let me be humiliated,<br>
for I have taken shelter in you.<br>
[21] May integrity and godliness protect me,<br>
for I rely on you.<br>
[22] O God, rescue Israel<br>
from all their distress!<br>
## Psalm 26

[1] Vindicate me, O **Lord**,<br>
for I have integrity,<br>
and I trust in the **Lord** without wavering.<br>
[2] Examine me, O **Lord**, and test me.<br>
Evaluate my inner thoughts and motives.<br>
[3] For I am ever aware of your faithfulness,<br>
and your loyalty continually motivates me.<br>
[4] I do not associate with deceitful men,<br>
or consort with those who are dishonest.<br>
[5] I hate the mob of evil men,<br>
and do not associate with the wicked.<br>
[6] I maintain a pure lifestyle,<br>
so I can appear before your altar, O **Lord**,<br>
[7] to give you thanks,<br>
and to tell about all your amazing deeds.<br>
[8] O **Lord**, I love the temple where you live,<br>
the place where your splendor is revealed.<br>
[9] Do not sweep me away with sinners,<br>
or execute me along with violent people,<br>
[10] who are always ready to do wrong<br>
or offer a bribe.<br>
[11] But I have integrity.<br>
Rescue me and have mercy on me!<br>
[12] I am safe,<br>
and among the worshipers I will praise the **Lord**.<br>
## Psalm 27

[1] The **Lord** is my light and my salvation.<br>
I fear no one.<br>
The **Lord** protects my life.<br>
I am afraid of no one.<br>
[2] When evil men attack me<br>
to devour my flesh,<br>
when my adversaries and enemies attack me,<br>
they stumble and fall.<br>
[3] Even when an army is deployed against me,<br>
I do not fear.<br>
Even when war is imminent,<br>
I remain confident.<br>
[4] I have asked the **Lord** for one thing—<br>
this is what I desire!<br>
I want to live in the **Lord**’s house all the days of my life,<br>
so I can gaze at the splendor of the **Lord**<br>
and contemplate in his temple.<br>
[5] He will surely give me shelter in the day of danger;<br>
he will hide me in his home.<br>
He will place me on an inaccessible rocky summit.<br>
[6] Now I will triumph<br>
over my enemies who surround me.<br>
I will offer sacrifices in his dwelling place and shout for joy.<br>
I will sing praises to the **Lord**.<br>
[7] Hear me, O **Lord**, when I cry out.<br>
Have mercy on me and answer me.<br>
[8] My heart tells me to pray to you,<br>
and I do pray to you, O **Lord**.<br>
[9] Do not reject me.<br>
Do not push your servant away in anger.<br>
You are my deliverer.<br>
Do not forsake or abandon me,<br>
O God who vindicates me.<br>
[10] Even if my father and mother abandoned me,<br>
the **Lord** would take me in.<br>
[11] Teach me how you want me to live, **Lord**;<br>
lead me along a level path because of those who wait to ambush me.<br>
[12] Do not turn me over to my enemies,<br>
for false witnesses who want to destroy me testify against me.<br>
[13] Where would I be if I did not believe I would experience<br>
the **Lord**’s favor in the land of the living?<br>
[14] Rely on the **Lord**!<br>
Be strong and confident!<br>
Rely on the **Lord**!<br>
## Psalm 28

[1] To you, O **Lord**, I cry out!<br>
My Protector, do not ignore me.<br>
If you do not respond to me,<br>
I will join those who are descending into the grave.<br>
[2] Hear my plea for mercy when I cry out to you for help,<br>
when I lift my hands toward your holy temple.<br>
[3] Do not drag me away with evil men,<br>
with those who behave wickedly,<br>
who talk so friendly to their neighbors,<br>
while they plan to harm them.<br>
[4] Pay them back for their evil deeds.<br>
Pay them back for what they do.<br>
Punish them.<br>
[5] For they do not understand the **Lord**’s actions,<br>
or the way he carries out justice.<br>
The **Lord** will permanently demolish them.<br>
[6] The **Lord** deserves praise,<br>
for he has heard my plea for mercy.<br>
[7] The **Lord** strengthens and protects me;<br>
I trust in him with all my heart.<br>
I am rescued and my heart is full of joy;<br>
I will sing to him in gratitude.<br>
[8] The **Lord** strengthens his people;<br>
he protects and delivers his chosen king.<br>
[9] Deliver your people.<br>
Empower the nation that belongs to you.<br>
Care for them like a shepherd and carry them in your arms at all times!<br>
## Psalm 29

[1] Acknowledge the **Lord**, you heavenly beings,<br>
acknowledge the **Lord**’s majesty and power.<br>
[2] Acknowledge the majesty of the **Lord**’s reputation.<br>
Worship the **Lord** in holy attire.<br>
[3] The **Lord**’s shout is heard over the water;<br>
the majestic God thunders,<br>
the **Lord** appears over the surging water.<br>
[4] The **Lord**’s shout is powerful,<br>
the **Lord**’s shout is majestic.<br>
[5] The **Lord**’s shout breaks the cedars,<br>
the **Lord** shatters the cedars of Lebanon.<br>
[6] He makes them skip like a calf,<br>
Lebanon and Sirion like a young ox.<br>
[7] The **Lord**’s shout strikes with flaming fire.<br>
[8] The **Lord**’s shout shakes the wilderness,<br>
the **Lord** shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.<br>
[9] The **Lord**’s shout bends the large trees<br>
and strips the leaves from the forests.<br>
Everyone in his temple says, “Majestic!”<br>
[10] The **Lord** sits enthroned over the engulfing waters,<br>
the **Lord** sits enthroned as the eternal king.<br>
[11] The **Lord** gives his people strength;<br>
the **Lord** grants his people security.<br>
## Psalm 30

[1] I will praise you, O **Lord**, for you lifted me up,<br>
and did not allow my enemies to gloat over me.<br>
[2] O **Lord** my God,<br>
I cried out to you and you healed me.<br>
[3] O **Lord**, you pulled me up from Sheol;<br>
you rescued me from among those descending into the grave.<br>
[4] Sing to the **Lord**, you faithful followers of his;<br>
give thanks to his holy name.<br>
[5] For his anger lasts only a brief moment,<br>
and his good favor restores one’s life.<br>
One may experience sorrow during the night,<br>
but joy arrives in the morning.<br>
[6] In my self-confidence I said,<br>
“I will never be shaken.”<br>
[7] O **Lord**, in your good favor you made me secure.<br>
Then you rejected me and I was terrified.<br>
[8] To you, O **Lord**, I cried out;<br>
I begged the Lord for mercy:<br>
[9] “What profit is there in taking my life,<br>
in my descending into the Pit?<br>
Can the dust of the grave praise you?<br>
Can it declare your loyalty?<br>
[10] Hear, O **Lord**, and have mercy on me.<br>
O **Lord**, deliver me.”<br>
[11] Then you turned my lament into dancing;<br>
you removed my sackcloth and covered me with joy.<br>
[12] So now my heart will sing to you and not be silent;<br>
O **Lord** my God, I will always give thanks to you.<br>
## Psalm 31

[1] In you, O **Lord**, I have taken shelter.<br>
Never let me be humiliated.<br>
Vindicate me by rescuing me.<br>
[2] Listen to me.<br>
Quickly deliver me.<br>
Be my protector and refuge,<br>
a stronghold where I can be safe.<br>
[3] For you are my high ridge and my stronghold;<br>
for the sake of your own reputation you lead me and guide me.<br>
[4] You will free me from the net they hid for me,<br>
for you are my place of refuge.<br>
[5] Into your hand I entrust my life;<br>
you will rescue me, O **Lord**, the faithful God.<br>
[6] I hate those who serve worthless idols,<br>
but I trust in the **Lord**.<br>
[7] I will be happy and rejoice in your faithfulness,<br>
because you notice my pain<br>
and you are aware of how distressed I am.<br>
[8] You do not deliver me over to the power of the enemy;<br>
you enable me to stand in a wide open place.<br>
[9] Have mercy on me, **Lord**, for I am in distress!<br>
My eyes grow dim from suffering.<br>
I have lost my strength.<br>
[10] For my life nears its end in pain;<br>
my years draw to a close as I groan.<br>
My strength fails me because of my sin,<br>
and my bones become brittle.<br>
[11] Because of all my enemies, people disdain me;<br>
my neighbors are appalled by my suffering —<br>
those who know me are horrified by my condition;<br>
those who see me in the street run away from me.<br>
[12] I am forgotten, like a dead man no one thinks about;<br>
I am regarded as worthless, like a broken jar.<br>
[13] For I hear what so many are saying,<br>
the terrifying news that comes from every direction.<br>
When they plot together against me,<br>
they figure out how they can take my life.<br>
[14] But I trust in you, O **Lord**!<br>
I declare, “You are my God!”<br>
[15] You determine my destiny.<br>
Rescue me from the power of my enemies and those who chase me.<br>
[16] Smile on your servant.<br>
Deliver me because of your faithfulness.<br>
[17] O **Lord**, do not let me be humiliated,<br>
for I call out to you.<br>
May evil men be humiliated.<br>
May they go wailing to the grave.<br>
[18] May lying lips be silenced—<br>
lips that speak defiantly against the innocent<br>
with arrogance and contempt.<br>
[19] How great is your favor,<br>
which you store up for your loyal followers.<br>
In plain sight of everyone you bestow it on those who take shelter in you.<br>
[20] You hide them with you, where they are safe from the attacks of men;<br>
you conceal them in a shelter, where they are safe from slanderous attacks.<br>
[21] The **Lord** deserves praise<br>
for he demonstrated his amazing faithfulness to me when I was besieged by enemies.<br>
[22] I jumped to conclusions and said,<br>
“I am cut off from your presence!”<br>
But you heard my plea for mercy when I cried out to you for help.<br>
[23] Love the **Lord**, all you faithful followers of his!<br>
The **Lord** protects those who have integrity,<br>
but he pays back in full the one who acts arrogantly.<br>
[24] Be strong and confident,<br>
all you who wait on the **Lord**.<br>
## Psalm 32

[1] How blessed is the one whose rebellious acts are forgiven,<br>
whose sin is pardoned.<br>
[2] How blessed is the one whose wrongdoing the **Lord** does not punish,<br>
in whose spirit there is no deceit.<br>
[3] When I refused to confess my sin,<br>
my whole body wasted away,<br>
while I groaned in pain all day long.<br>
[4] For day and night you tormented me;<br>
you tried to destroy me in the intense heat of summer. (Selah)<br>
[5] Then I confessed my sin;<br>
I no longer covered up my wrongdoing.<br>
I said, “I will confess my rebellious acts to the **Lord**.”<br>
And then you forgave my sins. (Selah)<br>
[6] For this reason every one of your faithful followers should pray to you<br>
while there is a window of opportunity.<br>
Certainly when the surging water rises,<br>
it will not reach them.<br>
[7] You are my hiding place;<br>
you protect me from distress.<br>
You surround me with shouts of joy from those celebrating deliverance. (Selah)<br>
[8] I will instruct and teach you about how you should live.<br>
I will advise you as I look you in the eye.<br>
[9] Do not be like an unintelligent horse or mule,<br>
which will not obey you<br>
unless they are controlled by a bridle and bit.<br>
[10] An evil person suffers much pain,<br>
but the **Lord**’s faithfulness overwhelms the one who trusts in him.<br>
[11] Rejoice in the **Lord** and be happy, you who are godly!<br>
Shout for joy, all you who are morally upright!<br>
## Psalm 33

[1] You godly ones, shout for joy because of the **Lord**!<br>
It is appropriate for the morally upright to offer him praise.<br>
[2] Give thanks to the **Lord** with the harp.<br>
Sing to him to the accompaniment of a ten-stringed instrument.<br>
[3] Sing to him a new song.<br>
Play skillfully as you shout out your praises to him.<br>
[4] For the **Lord**’s decrees are just,<br>
and everything he does is fair.<br>
[5] He promotes equity and justice;<br>
the **Lord**’s faithfulness extends throughout the earth.<br>
[6] By the **Lord**’s decree the heavens were made,<br>
and by the breath of his mouth all the starry hosts.<br>
[7] He piles up the water of the sea;<br>
he puts the oceans in storehouses.<br>
[8] Let the whole earth fear the **Lord**.<br>
Let all who live in the world stand in awe of him.<br>
[9] For he spoke, and it came into existence.<br>
He issued the decree, and it stood firm.<br>
[10] The **Lord** frustrates the decisions of the nations;<br>
he nullifies the plans of the peoples.<br>
[11] The **Lord**’s decisions stand forever;<br>
his plans abide throughout the ages.<br>
[12] How blessed is the nation whose God is the **Lord**,<br>
the people whom he has chosen to be his special possession.<br>
[13] The **Lord** watches from heaven;<br>
he sees all people.<br>
[14] From the place where he lives he looks carefully<br>
at all the earth’s inhabitants.<br>
[15] He is the one who forms every human heart,<br>
and takes note of all their actions.<br>
[16] No king is delivered by his vast army;<br>
a warrior is not saved by his great might.<br>
[17] A horse disappoints those who trust in it for victory;<br>
despite its great strength, it cannot deliver.<br>
[18] Look, the **Lord** takes notice of his loyal followers,<br>
those who wait for him to demonstrate his faithfulness<br>
[19] by saving their lives from death<br>
and sustaining them during times of famine.<br>
[20] We wait for the **Lord**;<br>
he is our deliverer and shield.<br>
[21] For our hearts rejoice in him,<br>
for we trust in his holy name.<br>
[22] May we experience your faithfulness, O **Lord**,<br>
for we wait for you.<br>
## Psalm 34

[1] I will praise the **Lord** at all times;<br>
my mouth will continually praise him.<br>
[2] I will boast in the **Lord**;<br>
let the oppressed hear and rejoice.<br>
[3] Magnify the **Lord** with me.<br>
Let us praise his name together.<br>
[4] I sought the **Lord**’s help and he answered me;<br>
he delivered me from all my fears.<br>
[5] Look to him and be radiant;<br>
do not let your faces be ashamed.<br>
[6] This oppressed man cried out and the **Lord** heard;<br>
he saved him from all his troubles.<br>
[7] The angel of the **Lord** camps around<br>
the **Lord**’s loyal followers and delivers them.<br>
[8] Taste and see that the **Lord** is good.<br>
How blessed is the one who takes shelter in him.<br>
[9] Fear the **Lord**, you chosen people of his,<br>
for those who fear him lack nothing.<br>
[10] Even young lions sometimes lack food and are hungry,<br>
but those who seek the **Lord** lack no good thing.<br>
[11] Come children. Listen to me.<br>
I will teach you what it means to fear the **Lord**.<br>
[12] Do you want to really live?<br>
Would you love to live a long, happy life?<br>
[13] Then make sure you don’t speak evil words<br>
or use deceptive speech.<br>
[14] Turn away from evil and do what is right.<br>
Strive for peace and promote it.<br>
[15] The **Lord** pays attention to the godly<br>
and hears their cry for help.<br>
[16] But the **Lord** opposes evildoers<br>
and wipes out all memory of them from the earth.<br>
[17] The godly cry out and the **Lord** hears;<br>
he saves them from all their troubles.<br>
[18] The **Lord** is near the brokenhearted;<br>
he delivers those who are discouraged.<br>
[19] The godly face many dangers,<br>
but the **Lord** saves them from each one of them.<br>
[20] He protects all his bones;<br>
not one of them is broken.<br>
[21] Evil people self-destruct;<br>
those who hate the godly are punished.<br>
[22] The **Lord** rescues his servants;<br>
all who take shelter in him escape punishment.<br>
## Psalm 35

[1] O **Lord**, fight those who fight with me.<br>
Attack those who attack me.<br>
[2] Grab your small shield and large shield,<br>
and rise up to help me.<br>
[3] Use your spear and lance against those who chase me.<br>
Assure me with these words: “I am your deliverer.”<br>
[4] May those who seek my life be embarrassed and humiliated.<br>
May those who plan to harm me be turned back and ashamed.<br>
[5] May they be like wind-driven chaff,<br>
as the angel of the **Lord** attacks them.<br>
[6] May their path be dark and slippery,<br>
as the angel of the **Lord** chases them.<br>
[7] I did not harm them, but they hid a net to catch me<br>
and dug a pit to trap me.<br>
[8] Let destruction take them by surprise.<br>
Let the net they hid catch them.<br>
Let them fall into destruction.<br>
[9] Then I will rejoice in the **Lord**<br>
and be happy because of his deliverance.<br>
[10] With all my strength I will say,<br>
“O **Lord**, who can compare to you?<br>
You rescue the oppressed from those who try to overpower them,<br>
the oppressed and needy from those who try to rob them.”<br>
[11] Violent men perjure themselves,<br>
and falsely accuse me.<br>
[12] They repay me evil for the good I have done;<br>
I am overwhelmed with sorrow.<br>
[13] When they were sick, I wore sackcloth,<br>
and refrained from eating food.<br>
(If I am lying, may my prayers go unanswered.)<br>
[14] I mourned for them as I would for a friend or my brother.<br>
I bowed down in sorrow as if I were mourning for my mother.<br>
[15] But when I stumbled, they rejoiced and gathered together;<br>
they gathered together to ambush me.<br>
They tore at me without stopping to rest.<br>
[16] When I tripped, they taunted me relentlessly,<br>
and tried to bite me.<br>
[17] O Lord, how long are you going to watch this?<br>
Rescue me from their destructive attacks;<br>
guard my life from the young lions.<br>
[18] Then I will give you thanks in the great assembly;<br>
I will praise you before a large crowd of people.<br>
[19] Do not let those who are my enemies for no reason gloat over me.<br>
Do not let those who hate me without cause carry out their wicked schemes.<br>
[20] For they do not try to make peace with others,<br>
but plan ways to deceive those who live peacefully in the land.<br>
[21] They are ready to devour me;<br>
they say, “Aha! Aha! We’ve got you!”<br>
[22] But you take notice, **Lord**; do not be silent!<br>
O Lord, do not remain far away from me.<br>
[23] Rouse yourself, wake up and vindicate me.<br>
My God and Lord, defend my just cause.<br>
[24] Vindicate me by your justice, O **Lord** my God.<br>
Do not let them gloat over me.<br>
[25] Do not let them say to themselves, “Aha! We have what we wanted!”<br>
Do not let them say, “We have devoured him.”<br>
[26] May those who rejoice in my troubles be totally embarrassed and ashamed.<br>
May those who arrogantly taunt me be covered with shame and humiliation.<br>
[27] May those who desire my vindication shout for joy and rejoice.<br>
May they continually say, “May the **Lord** be praised, for he wants his servant to be secure.”<br>
[28] Then I will tell others about your justice,<br>
and praise you all day long.<br>
## Psalm 36

[1] An evil man is rebellious to the core.<br>
He does not fear God,<br>
[2] for he is too proud<br>
to recognize and give up his sin.<br>
[3] The words he speaks are sinful and deceitful;<br>
he does not care about doing what is wise and right.<br>
[4] While he lies in bed he plans ways to sin.<br>
He is committed to a sinful lifestyle;<br>
he does not reject what is evil.<br>
[5] O **Lord**, your loyal love reaches to the sky,<br>
your faithfulness to the clouds.<br>
[6] Your justice is like the highest mountains,<br>
your fairness like the deepest sea;<br>
you, **Lord**, preserve mankind and the animal kingdom.<br>
[7] How precious is your loyal love, O God!<br>
The human race finds shelter under your wings.<br>
[8] They are filled with food from your house,<br>
and you allow them to drink from the river of your delicacies.<br>
[9] For with you is the fountain of life;<br>
in your light we see light.<br>
[10] Extend your loyal love to your faithful followers,<br>
and vindicate the morally upright.<br>
[11] Do not let arrogant men overtake me,<br>
or let evil men make me homeless.<br>
[12] I can see the evildoers! They have fallen.<br>
They have been knocked down and are unable to get up.<br>
## Psalm 37

[1] Do not fret when wicked men seem to succeed.<br>
Do not envy evildoers.<br>
[2] For they will quickly dry up like grass,<br>
and wither away like plants.<br>
[3] Trust in the **Lord** and do what is right.<br>
Settle in the land and maintain your integrity.<br>
[4] Then you will take delight in the **Lord**,<br>
and he will answer your prayers.<br>
[5] Commit your future to the **Lord**.<br>
Trust in him, and he will act on your behalf.<br>
[6] He will vindicate you in broad daylight,<br>
and publicly defend your just cause.<br>
[7] Wait patiently for the **Lord**!<br>
Wait confidently for him!<br>
Do not fret over the apparent success of a sinner,<br>
a man who carries out wicked schemes.<br>
[8] Do not be angry and frustrated.<br>
Do not fret. That only leads to trouble.<br>
[9] Wicked men will be wiped out,<br>
but those who rely on the **Lord** are the ones who will possess the land.<br>
[10] Evil men will soon disappear;<br>
you will stare at the spot where they once were, but they will be gone.<br>
[11] But the oppressed will possess the land<br>
and enjoy great prosperity.<br>
[12] Evil men plot against the godly<br>
and viciously attack them.<br>
[13] The Lord laughs in disgust at them,<br>
for he knows that their day is coming.<br>
[14] Evil men draw their swords<br>
and prepare their bows,<br>
to bring down the oppressed and needy,<br>
and to slaughter those who are godly.<br>
[15] Their swords will pierce their own hearts,<br>
and their bows will be broken.<br>
[16] The little bit that a godly man owns is better than<br>
the wealth of many evil men,<br>
[17] for evil men will lose their power,<br>
but the **Lord** sustains the godly.<br>
[18] The **Lord** watches over the innocent day by day,<br>
and they possess a permanent inheritance.<br>
[19] They will not be ashamed when hard times come;<br>
when famine comes they will have enough to eat.<br>
[20] But evil men will die;<br>
the **Lord**’s enemies will be incinerated —<br>
they will go up in smoke.<br>
[21] Evil men borrow, but do not repay their debt,<br>
but the godly show compassion and are generous.<br>
[22] Surely those favored by the **Lord** will possess the land,<br>
but those rejected by him will be wiped out.<br>
[23] The **Lord** grants success to the one<br>
whose behavior he finds commendable.<br>
[24] Even if he trips, he will not fall headlong,<br>
for the **Lord** holds his hand.<br>
[25] I was once young, now I am old.<br>
I have never seen the godly abandoned,<br>
or their children forced to search for food.<br>
[26] All day long they show compassion and lend to others,<br>
and their children are blessed.<br>
[27] Turn away from evil. Do what is right.<br>
Then you will enjoy lasting security.<br>
[28] For the **Lord** promotes justice,<br>
and never abandons his faithful followers.<br>
They are permanently secure,<br>
but the children of the wicked are wiped out.<br>
[29] The godly will possess the land<br>
and will dwell in it permanently.<br>
[30] The godly speak wise words<br>
and promote justice.<br>
[31] The law of their God controls their thinking;<br>
their feet do not slip.<br>
[32] The wicked set an ambush for the godly<br>
and try to kill them.<br>
[33] But the **Lord** does not surrender the godly,<br>
or allow them to be condemned in a court of law.<br>
[34] Rely on the **Lord**. Obey his commands.<br>
Then he will permit you to possess the land;<br>
you will see the demise of the wicked.<br>
[35] I have seen ruthless, wicked people<br>
growing in influence, like a green tree grows in its native soil.<br>
[36] But then one passes by, and suddenly they have disappeared.<br>
I looked for them, but they could not be found.<br>
[37] Take note of the one who has integrity. Observe the upright.<br>
For the one who promotes peace has a future.<br>
[38] Sinful rebels are totally destroyed;<br>
the wicked have no future.<br>
[39] But the **Lord** delivers the godly;<br>
he protects them in times of trouble.<br>
[40] The **Lord** helps them and rescues them;<br>
he rescues them from the wicked and delivers them,<br>
for they seek his protection.<br>
## Psalm 38

[1] O **Lord**, do not continue to rebuke me in your anger.<br>
Do not continue to punish me in your raging fury.<br>
[2] For your arrows pierce me,<br>
and your hand presses me down.<br>
[3] My whole body is sick because of your judgment;<br>
I am deprived of health because of my sin.<br>
[4] For my sins overwhelm me;<br>
like a heavy load, they are too much for me to bear.<br>
[5] My wounds are infected and starting to smell,<br>
because of my foolish sins.<br>
[6] I am dazed and completely humiliated;<br>
all day long I walk around mourning.<br>
[7] For I am overcome with shame,<br>
and my whole body is sick.<br>
[8] I am numb with pain and severely battered;<br>
I groan loudly because of the anxiety I feel.<br>
[9] O Lord, you understand my heart’s desire;<br>
my groaning is not hidden from you.<br>
[10] My heart beats quickly;<br>
my strength leaves me.<br>
I can hardly see.<br>
[11] Because of my condition, even my friends and acquaintances keep their distance;<br>
my neighbors stand far away.<br>
[12] Those who seek my life try to entrap me;<br>
those who want to harm me speak destructive words.<br>
All day long they say deceitful things.<br>
[13] But I am like a deaf man—I hear nothing;<br>
I am like a mute who cannot speak.<br>
[14] I am like a man who cannot hear<br>
and is incapable of arguing his defense.<br>
[15] Yet I wait for you, O **Lord**!<br>
You will respond, O Lord, my God!<br>
[16] I have prayed for deliverance, because otherwise they will gloat over me;<br>
when my foot slips they will arrogantly taunt me.<br>
[17] For I am about to stumble,<br>
and I am in constant pain.<br>
[18] Yes, I confess my wrongdoing,<br>
and I am concerned about my sins.<br>
[19] But those who are my enemies for no reason are numerous;<br>
those who hate me without cause outnumber me.<br>
[20] They repay me evil for the good I have done;<br>
though I have tried to do good to them, they hurl accusations at me.<br>
[21] Do not abandon me, O **Lord**.<br>
My God, do not remain far away from me.<br>
[22] Hurry and help me, O Lord, my deliverer.<br>
## Psalm 39

[1] I decided, “I will watch what I say<br>
and make sure I do not sin with my tongue.<br>
I will put a muzzle over my mouth<br>
while in the presence of an evil person.”<br>
[2] I was stone silent;<br>
I held back the urge to speak.<br>
My frustration grew;<br>
[3] my anxiety intensified.<br>
As I thought about it, I became impatient.<br>
Finally I spoke these words:<br>
[4] “O **Lord**, help me understand my mortality<br>
and the brevity of life.<br>
Let me realize how quickly my life will pass.<br>
[5] Look, you make my days short-lived,<br>
and my life span is nothing from your perspective.<br>
Surely all people, even those who seem secure, are nothing but vapor. (Selah)<br>
[6] Surely people go through life as mere ghosts.<br>
Surely they accumulate worthless wealth<br>
without knowing who will eventually haul it away.”<br>
[7] But now, O Lord, upon what am I relying?<br>
You are my only hope!<br>
[8] Deliver me from all my sins of rebellion.<br>
Do not make me the object of fools’ insults.<br>
[9] I am silent and cannot open my mouth<br>
because of what you have done.<br>
[10] Please stop wounding me.<br>
You have almost beaten me to death.<br>
[11] You severely discipline people for their sins;<br>
like a moth you slowly devour their strength.<br>
Surely all people are a mere vapor. (Selah)<br>
[12] Hear my prayer, O **Lord**.<br>
Listen to my cry for help.<br>
Do not ignore my sobbing.<br>
For I am a resident foreigner with you,<br>
a temporary settler, just as all my ancestors were.<br>
[13] Turn your angry gaze away from me, so I can be happy<br>
before I pass away.<br>
## Psalm 40

[1] I relied completely on the **Lord**,<br>
and he turned toward me<br>
and heard my cry for help.<br>
[2] He lifted me out of the watery pit,<br>
out of the slimy mud.<br>
He placed my feet on a rock<br>
and gave me secure footing.<br>
[3] He gave me reason to sing a new song,<br>
praising our God.<br>
May many see what God has done,<br>
so that they might swear allegiance to him and trust in the **Lord**.<br>
[4] How blessed is the one who trusts in the **Lord**<br>
and does not seek help from the proud or from liars.<br>
[5] O **Lord**, my God, you have accomplished many things;<br>
you have done amazing things and carried out your purposes for us.<br>
No one can thwart you.<br>
I want to declare your deeds and talk about them,<br>
but they are too numerous to recount.<br>
[6] Receiving sacrifices and offerings are not your primary concern.<br>
You make that quite clear to me.<br>
You do not ask for burnt sacrifices and sin offerings.<br>
[7] Then I say,<br>
“Look, I come!<br>
What is written in the scroll pertains to me.<br>
[8] I want to do what pleases you, my God.<br>
Your law dominates my thoughts.”<br>
[9] I have told the great assembly about your justice.<br>
Look, I spare no words.<br>
O **Lord**, you know this is true.<br>
[10] I have not failed to tell about your justice;<br>
I spoke about your reliability and deliverance.<br>
I have not neglected to tell the great assembly about your loyal love and faithfulness.<br>
[11] O **Lord**, you do not withhold your compassion from me.<br>
May your loyal love and faithfulness continually protect me!<br>
[12] For innumerable dangers surround me.<br>
My sins overtake me<br>
so I am unable to see;<br>
they outnumber the hairs of my head<br>
so my strength fails me.<br>
[13] Please be willing, O **Lord**, to rescue me!<br>
O **Lord**, hurry and help me!<br>
[14] May those who are trying to snatch away my life<br>
be totally embarrassed and ashamed.<br>
May those who want to harm me<br>
be turned back and ashamed.<br>
[15] May those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!”<br>
be humiliated and disgraced.<br>
[16] May all those who seek you be happy and rejoice in you.<br>
May those who love to experience your deliverance say continually,<br>
“May the **Lord** be praised!”<br>
[17] I am oppressed and needy.<br>
May the Lord pay attention to me.<br>
You are my helper and my deliverer.<br>
O my God, do not delay.<br>
## Psalm 41

[1] How blessed is the one who treats the poor properly.<br>
When trouble comes, may the **Lord** deliver him.<br>
[2] May the **Lord** protect him and save his life.<br>
May he be blessed in the land.<br>
Do not turn him over to his enemies.<br>
[3] The **Lord** supports him on his sickbed;<br>
you have healed him from his illness.<br>
[4] As for me, I said:<br>
“O **Lord**, have mercy on me!<br>
Heal me, for I have sinned against you.<br>
[5] My enemies ask this cruel question about me,<br>
‘When will he finally die and be forgotten?’<br>
[6] When someone comes to visit, he pretends to be friendly;<br>
he thinks of ways to defame me,<br>
and when he leaves he slanders me.<br>
[7] All who hate me whisper insults about me to one another;<br>
they plan ways to harm me.<br>
[8] They say,<br>
‘An awful disease overwhelms him,<br>
and now that he is bedridden he will never recover.’<br>
[9] Even my close friend whom I trusted,<br>
he who shared meals with me, has turned against me.<br>
[10] As for you, O **Lord**, have mercy on me and raise me up,<br>
so I can pay them back!”<br>
[11] By this I know that you are pleased with me,<br>
for my enemy does not triumph over me.<br>
[12] As for me, you uphold me because of my integrity;<br>
you allow me permanent access to your presence.<br>
[13] The **Lord** God of Israel deserves praise<br>
in the future and forevermore.<br>
We agree! We agree!<br>
## Psalm 42

### Book 2 (Psalms 42-72)

[1] As a deer longs for streams of water,<br>
so I long for you, O God!<br>
[2] I thirst for God,<br>
for the living God.<br>
I say, “When will I be able to go and appear in God’s presence?”<br>
[3] I cannot eat; I weep day and night.<br>
All day long they say to me, “Where is your God?”<br>
[4] I will remember and weep.<br>
For I was once walking along with the great throng to the temple of God,<br>
shouting and giving thanks along with the crowd as we celebrated the holy festival.<br>
[5] Why are you depressed, O my soul?<br>
Why are you upset?<br>
Wait for God!<br>
For I will again give thanks<br>
to my God for his saving intervention.<br>
[6] I am depressed,<br>
so I will pray to you while in the region of the upper Jordan,<br>
from Hermon, from Mount Mizar.<br>
[7] One deep stream calls out to another at the sound of your waterfalls;<br>
all your billows and waves overwhelm me.<br>
[8] By day the **Lord** decrees his loyal love,<br>
and by night he gives me a song,<br>
a prayer to the God of my life.<br>
[9] I will pray to God, my high ridge:<br>
“Why do you ignore me?<br>
Why must I walk around mourning<br>
because my enemies oppress me?”<br>
[10] My enemies’ taunts cut me to the bone,<br>
as they say to me all day long, “Where is your God?”<br>
[11] Why are you depressed, O my soul?<br>
Why are you upset?<br>
Wait for God!<br>
For I will again give thanks<br>
to my God for his saving intervention.<br>
## Psalm 43

[1] Vindicate me, O God!<br>
Fight for me against an ungodly nation.<br>
Deliver me from deceitful and evil men.<br>
[2] For you are the God who shelters me.<br>
Why do you reject me?<br>
Why must I walk around mourning<br>
because my enemies oppress me?<br>
[3] Reveal your light and your faithfulness.<br>
They will lead me;<br>
they will escort me back to your holy hill,<br>
and to the place where you live.<br>
[4] Then I will go to the altar of God,<br>
to the God who gives me ecstatic joy,<br>
so that I may express my thanks to you, O God, my God, with a harp.<br>
[5] Why are you depressed, O my soul?<br>
Why are you upset?<br>
Wait for God!<br>
For I will again give thanks<br>
to my God for his saving intervention.<br>
## Psalm 44

[1] O God, we have clearly heard;<br>
our ancestors have told us<br>
what you did in their days,<br>
in ancient times.<br>
[2] You, by your power, defeated nations and settled our fathers on their land;<br>
you crushed the people living there and enabled our ancestors to occupy it.<br>
[3] For they did not conquer the land by their swords,<br>
and they did not prevail by their strength,<br>
but rather by your power, strength, and good favor,<br>
for you were partial to them.<br>
[4] You are my king, O God.<br>
Decree Jacob’s deliverance.<br>
[5] By your power we will drive back our enemies;<br>
by your strength we will trample down our foes.<br>
[6] For I do not trust in my bow,<br>
and I do not prevail by my sword.<br>
[7] For you deliver us from our enemies;<br>
you humiliate those who hate us.<br>
[8] In God we boast all day long,<br>
and we will continually give thanks to your name. (Selah)<br>
[9] But you rejected and embarrassed us.<br>
You did not go into battle with our armies.<br>
[10] You made us retreat from the enemy.<br>
Those who hate us take whatever they want from us.<br>
[11] You handed us over like sheep to be eaten;<br>
you scattered us among the nations.<br>
[12] You sold your people for a pittance;<br>
you did not ask a high price for them.<br>
[13] You made us an object of disdain to our neighbors;<br>
those who live on our borders taunt and insult us.<br>
[14] You made us an object of ridicule among the nations;<br>
foreigners treat us with contempt.<br>
[15] All day long I feel humiliated<br>
and am overwhelmed with shame,<br>
[16] before the vindictive enemy<br>
who ridicules and insults me.<br>
[17] All this has happened to us, even though we have not rejected you<br>
or violated your covenant with us.<br>
[18] We have not been unfaithful,<br>
nor have we disobeyed your commands.<br>
[19] Yet you have battered us, leaving us a heap of ruins overrun by wild dogs;<br>
you have covered us with darkness.<br>
[20] If we had rejected our God,<br>
and spread out our hands in prayer to another god,<br>
[21] would not God discover it,<br>
for he knows a person’s secret thoughts?<br>
[22] Yet because of you we are killed all day long;<br>
we are treated like sheep at the slaughtering block.<br>
[23] Rouse yourself! Why do you sleep, O Lord?<br>
Wake up! Do not reject us forever.<br>
[24] Why do you look the other way,<br>
and ignore the way we are oppressed and mistreated?<br>
[25] For we lie in the dirt,<br>
with our bellies pressed to the ground.<br>
[26] Rise up and help us.<br>
Rescue us because of your loyal love.<br>
## Psalm 45

[1] My heart is stirred by a beautiful song.<br>
I say, “I have composed this special song for the king;<br>
my tongue is as skilled as the stylus of an experienced scribe.”<br>
[2] You are the most handsome of all men.<br>
You speak in an impressive and fitting manner.<br>
For this reason God grants you continual blessings.<br>
[3] Strap your sword to your thigh, O warrior.<br>
Appear in your majestic splendor.<br>
[4] Appear in your majesty and be victorious.<br>
Ride forth for the sake of what is right,<br>
on behalf of justice.<br>
Then your right hand will accomplish mighty acts.<br>
[5] Your arrows are sharp<br>
and penetrate the hearts of the king’s enemies.<br>
Nations fall at your feet.<br>
[6] Your throne, O God, is permanent.<br>
The scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of justice.<br>
[7] You love justice and hate evil.<br>
For this reason God, your God, has anointed you<br>
with the oil of joy, elevating you above your companions.<br>
[8] All your garments are perfumed with myrrh, aloes, and cassia.<br>
From the luxurious palaces comes the music of stringed instruments that makes you happy.<br>
[9] Princesses are among your honored women.<br>
Your bride stands at your right hand, wearing jewelry made with gold from Ophir.<br>
[10] Listen, O princess.<br>
Observe and pay attention!<br>
Forget your homeland and your family.<br>
[11] Then the king will be attracted by your beauty.<br>
After all, he is your master. Submit to him.<br>
[12] Rich people from Tyre<br>
will seek your favor by bringing a gift.<br>
[13] The princess looks absolutely magnificent,<br>
decked out in pearls and clothed in a brocade trimmed with gold.<br>
[14] In embroidered robes she is escorted to the king.<br>
Her attendants, the maidens of honor who follow her,<br>
are led before you.<br>
[15] They are bubbling with joy as they walk in procession<br>
and enter the royal palace.<br>
[16] Your sons will carry on the dynasty of your ancestors;<br>
you will make them princes throughout the land.<br>
[17] I will proclaim your greatness through the coming years,<br>
then the nations will praise you forever.<br>
## Psalm 46

[1] God is our strong refuge;<br>
he is truly our helper in times of trouble.<br>
[2] For this reason we do not fear when the earth shakes,<br>
and the mountains tumble into the depths of the sea,<br>
[3] when its waves crash and foam,<br>
and the mountains shake before the surging sea. (Selah)<br>
[4] The river’s channels bring joy to the city of God,<br>
the special, holy dwelling place of the Most High.<br>
[5] God lives within it, it cannot be moved.<br>
God rescues it at the break of dawn.<br>
[6] Nations are in uproar, kingdoms are overthrown.<br>
God gives a shout, the earth dissolves.<br>
[7] The **Lord** of Heaven’s Armies is on our side.<br>
The God of Jacob is our stronghold. (Selah)<br>
[8] Come, Witness the exploits of the **Lord**,<br>
who brings devastation to the earth.<br>
[9] He brings an end to wars throughout the earth.<br>
He shatters the bow and breaks the spear;<br>
he burns the shields with fire.<br>
[10] He says, “Stop your striving and recognize that I am God.<br>
I will be exalted over the nations! I will be exalted over the earth!”<br>
[11] The **Lord** of Heaven’s Armies is on our side!<br>
The God of Jacob is our stronghold! (Selah)<br>
## Psalm 47

[1] All you nations, clap your hands.<br>
Shout out to God in celebration.<br>
[2] For the **Lord** Most High is awe-inspiring;<br>
he is the great king who rules the whole earth!<br>
[3] He subdued nations beneath us<br>
and countries under our feet.<br>
[4] He picked out for us a special land<br>
to be a source of pride for Jacob, whom he loves. (Selah)<br>
[5] God has ascended his throne amid loud shouts;<br>
the **Lord** has ascended amid the blaring of ram’s horns.<br>
[6] Sing to God! Sing!<br>
Sing to our king! Sing!<br>
[7] For God is king of the whole earth.<br>
Sing a well-written song.<br>
[8] God reigns over the nations.<br>
God sits on his holy throne.<br>
[9] The nobles of the nations assemble,<br>
along with the people of the God of Abraham,<br>
for God has authority over the rulers of the earth.<br>
He is highly exalted.<br>
## Psalm 48

[1] The **Lord** is great and certainly worthy of praise<br>
in the city of our God, his holy hill.<br>
[2] It is lofty and pleasing to look at,<br>
a source of joy to the whole earth.<br>
Mount Zion resembles the peaks of Zaphon;<br>
it is the city of the great king.<br>
[3] God is in its fortresses;<br>
he reveals himself as its defender.<br>
[4] For look, the kings assemble;<br>
they advance together.<br>
[5] As soon as they see, they are shocked;<br>
they are terrified, they quickly retreat.<br>
[6] Look at them shake uncontrollably,<br>
like a woman writhing in childbirth.<br>
[7] With an east wind<br>
you shatter the large ships.<br>
[8] We heard about God’s mighty deeds; now we have seen them,<br>
in the city of the **Lord** of Heaven’s Armies,<br>
in the city of our God.<br>
God makes it permanently secure. (Selah)<br>
[9] Within your temple<br>
we reflect on your loyal love, O God.<br>
[10] The praise you receive as far away as the ends of the earth<br>
is worthy of your reputation, O God.<br>
You execute justice.<br>
[11] Mount Zion rejoices;<br>
the towns of Judah are happy,<br>
because of your acts of judgment.<br>
[12] Walk around Zion. Encircle it.<br>
Count its towers.<br>
[13] Consider its defenses.<br>
Walk through its fortresses,<br>
so you can tell the next generation about it.<br>
[14] For God, our God, is our defender forever.<br>
He guides us.<br>
## Psalm 49

[1] Listen to this, all you nations.<br>
Pay attention, all you inhabitants of the world.<br>
[2] Pay attention, all you people,<br>
both rich and poor.<br>
[3] I will declare a wise saying;<br>
I will share my profound thoughts.<br>
[4] I will learn a song that imparts wisdom;<br>
I will then sing my insightful song to the accompaniment of a harp.<br>
[5] Why should I be afraid in times of trouble,<br>
when the sinful deeds of deceptive men threaten to overwhelm me?<br>
[6] They trust in their wealth<br>
and boast in their great riches.<br>
[7] Certainly a man cannot rescue his brother;<br>
he cannot pay God an adequate ransom price<br>
[8] (the ransom price for a human life is too high,<br>
and people go to their final destiny),<br>
[9] so that he might continue to live forever<br>
and not experience death.<br>
[10] Surely one sees that even wise people die;<br>
fools and spiritually insensitive people all pass away<br>
and leave their wealth to others.<br>
[11] Their grave becomes their permanent residence,<br>
their eternal dwelling place.<br>
They name their lands after themselves,<br>
[12] but, despite their wealth, people do not last.<br>
They are like animals that perish.<br>
[13] This is the destiny of fools,<br>
and of those who approve of their philosophy. (Selah)<br>
[14] They will travel to Sheol like sheep,<br>
with death as their shepherd.<br>
The godly will rule over them when the day of vindication dawns.<br>
Sheol will consume their bodies, and they will no longer live in impressive houses.<br>
[15] But God will rescue my life from the power of Sheol;<br>
certainly he will pull me to safety. (Selah)<br>
[16] Do not be afraid when a man becomes rich<br>
and his wealth multiplies.<br>
[17] For he will take nothing with him when he dies;<br>
his wealth will not follow him down into the grave.<br>
[18] He pronounces this blessing on himself while he is alive:<br>
“May men praise you, for you have done well.”<br>
[19] But he will join his ancestors;<br>
they will never again see the light of day.<br>
[20] Wealthy people do not understand;<br>
they are like animals that perish.<br>
## Psalm 50

[1] El, God, the **Lord** has spoken,<br>
and summoned the earth to come from the east and west.<br>
[2] From Zion, the most beautiful of all places,<br>
God has come in splendor.<br>
[3] “May our God come<br>
and not be silent.”<br>
Consuming fire goes ahead of him,<br>
and all around him a storm rages.<br>
[4] He summons the heavens above,<br>
as well as the earth, so that he might judge his people.<br>
[5] He says:<br>
“Assemble my covenant people before me,<br>
those who ratified a covenant with me by sacrifice.”<br>
[6] The heavens declare his fairness,<br>
for God is judge. (Selah)<br>
[7] He says:<br>
“Listen, my people. I am speaking!<br>
Listen, Israel. I am accusing you.<br>
I am God, your God!<br>
[8] I am not condemning you because of your sacrifices,<br>
or because of your burnt sacrifices that you continually offer me.<br>
[9] I do not need to take a bull from your household<br>
or goats from your sheepfolds.<br>
[10] For every wild animal in the forest belongs to me,<br>
as well as the cattle that graze on a thousand hills.<br>
[11] I keep track of every bird in the hills,<br>
and the insects of the field are mine.<br>
[12] Even if I were hungry, I would not tell you,<br>
for the world and all it contains belong to me.<br>
[13] Do I eat the flesh of bulls?<br>
Do I drink the blood of goats?<br>
[14] Present to God a thank offering.<br>
Repay your vows to the Most High.<br>
[15] Pray to me when you are in trouble.<br>
I will deliver you, and you will honor me.”<br>
[16] God says this to the evildoer:<br>
“How can you declare my commands,<br>
and talk about my covenant?<br>
[17] For you hate instruction<br>
and reject my words.<br>
[18] When you see a thief, you join him;<br>
you associate with men who are unfaithful to their wives.<br>
[19] You do damage with words,<br>
and use your tongue to deceive.<br>
[20] You plot against your brother;<br>
you slander your own brother.<br>
[21] When you did these things, I was silent,<br>
so you thought I was exactly like you.<br>
But now I will condemn you<br>
and state my case against you.<br>
[22] Carefully consider this, you who reject God.<br>
Otherwise I will rip you to shreds<br>
and no one will be able to rescue you.<br>
[23] Whoever presents a thank offering honors me.<br>
To whoever obeys my commands, I will reveal my power to deliver.”<br>
## Psalm 51

[1] Have mercy on me, O God, because of your loyal love.<br>
Because of your great compassion, wipe away my rebellious acts.<br>
[2] Wash away my wrongdoing.<br>
Cleanse me of my sin.<br>
[3] For I am aware of my rebellious acts;<br>
I am forever conscious of my sin.<br>
[4] Against you—you above all —I have sinned;<br>
I have done what is evil in your sight.<br>
So you are just when you confront me;<br>
you are right when you condemn me.<br>
[5] Look, I was guilty of sin from birth,<br>
a sinner the moment my mother conceived me.<br>
[6] Look, you desire integrity in the inner man;<br>
you want me to possess wisdom.<br>
[7] Cleanse me with hyssop and I will be pure;<br>
wash me and I will be whiter than snow.<br>
[8] Grant me the ultimate joy of being forgiven.<br>
May the bones you crushed rejoice.<br>
[9] Hide your face from my sins.<br>
Wipe away all my guilt.<br>
[10] Create for me a pure heart, O God.<br>
Renew a resolute spirit within me.<br>
[11] Do not reject me.<br>
Do not take your holy Spirit away from me.<br>
[12] Let me again experience the joy of your deliverance.<br>
Sustain me by giving me the desire to obey.<br>
[13] Then I will teach rebels your merciful ways,<br>
and sinners will turn to you.<br>
[14] Rescue me from the guilt of murder, O God, the God who delivers me.<br>
Then my tongue will shout for joy because of your righteousness.<br>
[15] O Lord, give me the words.<br>
Then my mouth will praise you.<br>
[16] Certainly you do not want a sacrifice, or else I would offer it;<br>
you do not desire a burnt sacrifice.<br>
[17] The sacrifice God desires is a humble spirit —<br>
O God, a humble and repentant heart you will not reject.<br>
[18] Because you favor Zion, do what is good for her.<br>
Fortify the walls of Jerusalem.<br>
[19] Then you will accept the proper sacrifices, burnt sacrifices and whole offerings;<br>
then bulls will be sacrificed on your altar.<br>
## Psalm 52

[1] Why do you boast about your evil plans, O powerful man?<br>
God’s loyal love protects me all day long.<br>
[2] Your tongue carries out your destructive plans;<br>
it is as effective as a sharp razor, O deceiver.<br>
[3] You love evil more than good,<br>
lies more than speaking the truth. (Selah)<br>
[4] You love to use all the words that destroy,<br>
and the tongue that deceives.<br>
[5] Yet God will make you a permanent heap of ruins.<br>
He will scoop you up and remove you from your home;<br>
he will uproot you from the land of the living. (Selah)<br>
[6] When the godly see this, they will be filled with awe,<br>
and will mock the evildoer, saying:<br>
[7] “Look, here is the man who would not make God his protector.<br>
He trusted in his great wealth<br>
and was confident about his plans to destroy others.”<br>
[8] But I am like a flourishing olive tree in the house of God;<br>
I continually trust in God’s loyal love.<br>
[9] I will continually thank you when you execute judgment;<br>
I will rely on you, for your loyal followers know you are good.<br>
## Psalm 53

[1] Fools say to themselves, “There is no God.”<br>
They sin and commit evil deeds;<br>
none of them does what is right.<br>
[2] God looks down from heaven at the human race,<br>
to see if there is anyone who is wise and seeks God.<br>
[3] Everyone rejects God;<br>
they are all morally corrupt.<br>
None of them does what is right,<br>
not even one!<br>
[4] All those who behave wickedly do not understand —<br>
those who devour my people as if they were eating bread,<br>
and do not call out to God.<br>
[5] They are absolutely terrified,<br>
even by things that do not normally cause fear.<br>
For God annihilates those who attack you.<br>
You are able to humiliate them because God has rejected them.<br>
[6] I wish the deliverance of Israel would come from Zion!<br>
When God restores the well-being of his people,<br>
may Jacob rejoice,<br>
may Israel be happy!<br>
## Psalm 54

[1] O God, deliver me by your name.<br>
Vindicate me by your power.<br>
[2] O God, listen to my prayer.<br>
Pay attention to what I say.<br>
[3] For foreigners attack me;<br>
ruthless men, who do not respect God, seek my life. (Selah)<br>
[4] Look, God is my deliverer.<br>
The Lord is among those who support me.<br>
[5] May those who wait to ambush me be repaid for their evil.<br>
As a demonstration of your faithfulness, destroy them.<br>
[6] With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to you.<br>
I will give thanks to your name, O **Lord**, for it is good.<br>
[7] Surely he rescues me from all trouble,<br>
and I triumph over my enemies.<br>
## Psalm 55

[1] Listen, O God, to my prayer.<br>
Do not ignore my appeal for mercy.<br>
[2] Pay attention to me and answer me.<br>
I am so upset and distressed, I am beside myself,<br>
[3] because of what the enemy says,<br>
and because of how the wicked pressure me,<br>
for they hurl trouble down upon me<br>
and angrily attack me.<br>
[4] My heart beats violently within me;<br>
the horrors of death overcome me.<br>
[5] Fear and panic overpower me;<br>
terror overwhelms me.<br>
[6] I say, “I wish I had wings like a dove.<br>
I would fly away and settle in a safe place.<br>
[7] Look, I will escape to a distant place;<br>
I will stay in the wilderness. (Selah)<br>
[8] I will hurry off to a place that is safe<br>
from the strong wind and the gale.”<br>
[9] Confuse them, O Lord.<br>
Frustrate their plans.<br>
For I see violence and conflict in the city.<br>
[10] Day and night they walk around on its walls,<br>
while wickedness and destruction are within it.<br>
[11] Disaster is within it;<br>
violence and deceit do not depart from its public square.<br>
[12] Indeed, it is not an enemy who insults me,<br>
or else I could bear it;<br>
it is not one who hates me who arrogantly taunts me,<br>
or else I could hide from him.<br>
[13] But it is you, a man like me,<br>
my close friend in whom I confided.<br>
[14] We would share personal thoughts with each other;<br>
in God’s temple we would walk together among the crowd.<br>
[15] May death destroy them.<br>
May they go down alive into Sheol.<br>
For evil is in their dwelling place and in their midst.<br>
[16] As for me, I will call out to God,<br>
and the **Lord** will deliver me.<br>
[17] During the evening, morning, and noontime<br>
I will lament and moan,<br>
and he will hear me.<br>
[18] He will rescue me and protect me from those who attack me,<br>
even though they greatly outnumber me.<br>
[19] God, the one who has reigned as king from long ago,<br>
will hear and humiliate them. (Selah)<br>
They refuse to change,<br>
and do not fear God.<br>
[20] He attacks his friends;<br>
he breaks his solemn promises to them.<br>
[21] His words are as smooth as butter,<br>
but he harbors animosity in his heart.<br>
His words seem softer than oil,<br>
but they are really like sharp swords.<br>
[22] Throw your burden upon the **Lord**,<br>
and he will sustain you.<br>
He will never allow the godly to be shaken.<br>
[23] But you, O God, will bring them down to the deep Pit.<br>
Violent and deceitful people will not live even half a normal lifespan.<br>
But as for me, I trust in you.<br>
## Psalm 56

[1] Have mercy on me, O God, for men are attacking me.<br>
All day long hostile enemies are tormenting me.<br>
[2] Those who anticipate my defeat attack me all day long.<br>
Indeed, many are fighting against me, O Exalted One.<br>
[3] When I am afraid,<br>
I trust in you.<br>
[4] In God—I boast in his promise —<br>
in God I trust; I am not afraid.<br>
What can mere men do to me?<br>
[5] All day long they cause me trouble;<br>
they make a habit of plotting my demise.<br>
[6] They stalk and lurk;<br>
they watch my every step,<br>
as they prepare to take my life.<br>
[7] Because they are bent on violence, do not let them escape.<br>
In your anger bring down the nations, O God.<br>
[8] You keep track of my misery.<br>
Put my tears in your leather container.<br>
Are they not recorded in your scroll?<br>
[9] My enemies will turn back when I cry out to you for help;<br>
I know that God is on my side.<br>
[10] In God—I boast in his promise —<br>
in the **Lord**—I boast in his promise —<br>
[11] in God I trust; I am not afraid.<br>
What can mere men do to me?<br>
[12] I am obligated to fulfill the vows I made to you, O God;<br>
I will give you the thank offerings you deserve,<br>
[13] when you deliver my life from death.<br>
You keep my feet from stumbling,<br>
so that I might serve God as I enjoy life.<br>
## Psalm 57

[1] Have mercy on me, O God. Have mercy on me.<br>
For in you I have taken shelter.<br>
In the shadow of your wings I take shelter<br>
until trouble passes.<br>
[2] I cry out for help to God Most High,<br>
to the God who vindicates me.<br>
[3] May he send help from heaven and deliver me<br>
from my enemies who hurl insults. (Selah)<br>
May God send his loyal love and faithfulness.<br>
[4] I am surrounded by lions;<br>
I lie down among those who want to devour me,<br>
men whose teeth are spears and arrows,<br>
whose tongues are sharp swords.<br>
[5] Rise up above the sky, O God.<br>
May your splendor cover the whole earth.<br>
[6] They have prepared a net to trap me;<br>
I am discouraged.<br>
They have dug a pit for me.<br>
They will fall into it. (Selah)<br>
[7] I am determined, O God. I am determined.<br>
I will sing and praise you.<br>
[8] Awake, my soul!<br>
Awake, O stringed instrument and harp!<br>
I will wake up at dawn.<br>
[9] I will give you thanks before the nations, O Lord.<br>
I will sing praises to you before foreigners.<br>
[10] For your loyal love extends beyond the sky,<br>
and your faithfulness reaches the clouds.<br>
[11] Rise up above the sky, O God.<br>
May your splendor cover the whole earth.<br>
## Psalm 58

[1] Do you rulers really pronounce just decisions?<br>
Do you judge people fairly?<br>
[2] No! You plan how to do what is unjust;<br>
you deal out violence in the earth.<br>
[3] The wicked turn aside from birth;<br>
liars go astray as soon as they are born.<br>
[4] Their venom is like that of a snake,<br>
like a deaf serpent that does not hear,<br>
[5] that does not respond to the magicians,<br>
or to a skilled snake charmer.<br>
[6] O God, break the teeth in their mouths!<br>
Smash the jawbones of the lions, O **Lord**.<br>
[7] Let them disappear like water that flows away.<br>
Let them wither like grass.<br>
[8] Let them be like a snail that melts away as it moves along.<br>
Let them be like stillborn babies that never see the sun.<br>
[9] Before the kindling is even placed under your pots,<br>
he will sweep it away along with both the raw and cooked meat.<br>
[10] The godly will rejoice when they see vengeance carried out;<br>
they will bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked.<br>
[11] Then observers will say,<br>
“Yes indeed, the godly are rewarded.<br>
Yes indeed, there is a God who judges in the earth.”<br>
## Psalm 59

[1] Deliver me from my enemies, my God.<br>
Protect me from those who attack me.<br>
[2] Deliver me from evildoers.<br>
Rescue me from violent men.<br>
[3] For look, they wait to ambush me;<br>
powerful men stalk me,<br>
but not because I have rebelled or sinned, O **Lord**.<br>
[4] Though I have done nothing wrong, they are anxious to attack.<br>
Spring into action and help me. Take notice of me.<br>
[5] You, O **Lord** God of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel,<br>
rouse yourself and punish all the nations.<br>
Have no mercy on any treacherous evildoers. (Selah)<br>
[6] They return in the evening;<br>
they growl like dogs<br>
and prowl around outside the city.<br>
[7] Look, they hurl insults at me<br>
and openly threaten to kill me,<br>
for they say,<br>
“Who hears?”<br>
[8] But you, O **Lord**, laugh in disgust at them;<br>
you taunt all the nations.<br>
[9] You are my source of strength. I will wait for you.<br>
For God is my refuge.<br>
[10] The God who loves me will help me;<br>
God will enable me to triumph over my enemies.<br>
[11] Do not strike them dead suddenly,<br>
because then my people might forget the lesson.<br>
Use your power to make them homeless vagabonds and then bring them down,<br>
O Lord who shields us.<br>
[12] They speak sinful words.<br>
So let them be trapped by their own pride<br>
and by the curses and lies they speak.<br>
[13] Angrily wipe them out. Wipe them out so they vanish.<br>
Let them know that God rules<br>
over Jacob and to the ends of the earth. (Selah)<br>
[14] They return in the evening;<br>
they growl like dogs<br>
and prowl around outside the city.<br>
[15] They wander around looking for something to eat;<br>
they refuse to sleep until they are full.<br>
[16] As for me, I will sing about your strength;<br>
I will praise your loyal love in the morning.<br>
For you are my refuge<br>
and my place of shelter when I face trouble.<br>
[17] You are my source of strength. I will sing praises to you.<br>
For God is my refuge, the God who loves me.<br>
## Psalm 60

[1] O God, you have rejected us.<br>
You suddenly turned on us in your anger.<br>
Please restore us!<br>
[2] You made the earth quake; you split it open.<br>
Repair its breaches, for it is ready to fall.<br>
[3] You have made your people experience hard times;<br>
you have made us drink intoxicating wine.<br>
[4] You have given your loyal followers a rallying flag,<br>
so that they might seek safety from the bow. (Selah)<br>
[5] Deliver by your power and answer me,<br>
so that the ones you love may be safe.<br>
[6] God has spoken in his sanctuary:<br>
“I will triumph. I will parcel out Shechem;<br>
the Valley of Sukkoth I will measure off.<br>
[7] Gilead belongs to me,<br>
as does Manasseh.<br>
Ephraim is my helmet,<br>
Judah my royal scepter.<br>
[8] Moab is my washbasin.<br>
I will make Edom serve me.<br>
I will shout in triumph over Philistia.”<br>
[9] Who will lead me into the fortified city?<br>
Who will bring me to Edom?<br>
[10] Have you not rejected us, O God?<br>
O God, you do not go into battle with our armies.<br>
[11] Give us help against the enemy,<br>
for any help men might offer is futile.<br>
[12] By God’s power we will conquer;<br>
he will trample down our enemies.<br>
## Psalm 61

[1] O God, hear my cry for help.<br>
Pay attention to my prayer.<br>
[2] From the remotest place on earth<br>
I call out to you in my despair.<br>
Lead me up to a rocky summit where I can be safe.<br>
[3] Indeed, you are my shelter,<br>
a strong tower that protects me from the enemy.<br>
[4] I will be a permanent guest in your home;<br>
I will find shelter in the protection of your wings. (Selah)<br>
[5] For you, O God, hear my vows;<br>
you grant me the reward that belongs to your loyal followers.<br>
[6] Give the king long life.<br>
Make his lifetime span several generations.<br>
[7] May he reign forever before God.<br>
Decree that your loyal love and faithfulness should protect him.<br>
[8] Then I will sing praises to your name continually,<br>
as I fulfill my vows day after day.<br>
## Psalm 62

[1] For God alone I patiently wait;<br>
he is the one who delivers me.<br>
[2] He alone is my protector and deliverer.<br>
He is my refuge; I will not be upended.<br>
[3] How long will you threaten a man like me?<br>
All of you are murderers,<br>
as dangerous as a leaning wall or an unstable fence.<br>
[4] They spend all their time planning how to bring their victim down.<br>
They love to use deceit;<br>
they pronounce blessings with their mouths,<br>
but inwardly they utter curses. (Selah)<br>
[5] Patiently wait for God alone, my soul!<br>
For he is the one who gives me hope.<br>
[6] He alone is my protector and deliverer.<br>
He is my refuge; I will not be shaken.<br>
[7] God delivers me and exalts me;<br>
God is my strong protector and my shelter.<br>
[8] Trust in him at all times, you people!<br>
Pour out your hearts before him.<br>
God is our shelter. (Selah)<br>
[9] Men are nothing but a mere breath;<br>
human beings are unreliable.<br>
When they are weighed in the scales,<br>
all of them together are lighter than air.<br>
[10] Do not trust in what you can gain by oppression.<br>
Do not put false confidence in what you can gain by robbery.<br>
If wealth increases, do not become attached to it.<br>
[11] God has declared one principle;<br>
two principles I have heard:<br>
God is strong,<br>
[12] and you, O Lord, demonstrate loyal love.<br>
For you repay men for what they do.<br>
## Psalm 63

[1] O God, you are my God. I long for you.<br>
My soul thirsts for you,<br>
my flesh yearns for you,<br>
in a dry and parched land where there is no water.<br>
[2] Yes, in the sanctuary I have seen you,<br>
and witnessed your power and splendor.<br>
[3] Because experiencing your loyal love is better than life itself,<br>
my lips will praise you.<br>
[4] For this reason I will praise you while I live;<br>
in your name I will lift up my hands.<br>
[5] As with choice meat you satisfy my soul.<br>
My mouth joyfully praises you,<br>
[6] whenever I remember you on my bed,<br>
and think about you during the nighttime hours.<br>
[7] For you are my deliverer;<br>
under your wings I rejoice.<br>
[8] My soul pursues you;<br>
your right hand upholds me.<br>
[9] Enemies seek to destroy my life,<br>
but they will descend into the depths of the earth.<br>
[10] Each one will be handed over to the sword;<br>
their corpses will be eaten by jackals.<br>
[11] But the king will rejoice in God;<br>
everyone who takes oaths in his name will boast,<br>
for the mouths of those who speak lies will be shut up.<br>
## Psalm 64

[1] Listen to me, O God, as I offer my lament!<br>
Protect my life from the enemy’s terrifying attacks.<br>
[2] Hide me from the plots of evil men,<br>
from the crowd of evildoers.<br>
[3] They sharpen their tongues like swords;<br>
they aim their arrows, a slanderous charge,<br>
[4] in order to shoot down the innocent in secluded places.<br>
They shoot at him suddenly and are unafraid of retaliation.<br>
[5] They encourage one another to carry out their evil deed.<br>
They plan how to hide snares,<br>
and boast, “Who will see them?”<br>
[6] They devise unjust schemes;<br>
they disguise a well-conceived plot.<br>
Man’s inner thoughts cannot be discovered.<br>
[7] But God will shoot at them;<br>
suddenly they will be wounded by an arrow.<br>
[8] Their slander will bring about their demise.<br>
All who see them will shudder,<br>
[9] and all people will fear.<br>
They will proclaim what God has done,<br>
and reflect on his deeds.<br>
[10] The godly will rejoice in the **Lord**<br>
and take shelter in him.<br>
All the morally upright will boast.<br>
## Psalm 65

[1] Praise awaits you, O God, in Zion.<br>
Vows made to you are fulfilled.<br>
[2] You hear prayers;<br>
all people approach you.<br>
[3] Our record of sins overwhelms me,<br>
but you forgive our acts of rebellion.<br>
[4] How blessed is the one whom you choose,<br>
and allow to live in your palace courts.<br>
May we be satisfied with the good things of your house—<br>
your holy palace.<br>
[5] You answer our prayers by performing awesome acts of deliverance,<br>
O God, our savior.<br>
All the ends of the earth trust in you,<br>
as well as those living across the wide seas.<br>
[6] You created the mountains by your power,<br>
and demonstrated your strength.<br>
[7] You calmed the raging seas<br>
and their roaring waves,<br>
as well as the commotion made by the nations.<br>
[8] Even those living in the remotest areas are awestruck by your acts;<br>
you cause those living in the east and west to praise you.<br>
[9] You visit the earth and give it rain;<br>
you make it rich and fertile.<br>
God’s streams are full of water;<br>
you provide grain for the people of the earth,<br>
for you have prepared the earth in this way.<br>
[10] You saturate its furrows,<br>
and soak its plowed ground.<br>
With rain showers you soften its soil,<br>
and make its crops grow.<br>
[11] You crown the year with your good blessings,<br>
and you leave abundance in your wake.<br>
[12] The pastures in the wilderness glisten with moisture,<br>
and the hills are clothed with joy.<br>
[13] The meadows are clothed with sheep,<br>
and the valleys are covered with grain.<br>
They shout joyfully, yes, they sing.<br>
## Psalm 66

[1] Shout out praise to God, all the earth!<br>
[2] Sing praises about the majesty of his reputation.<br>
Give him the honor he deserves!<br>
[3] Say to God:<br>
“How awesome are your deeds!<br>
Because of your great power your enemies cower in fear before you.<br>
[4] All the earth worships you<br>
and sings praises to you.<br>
They sing praises to your name.” (Selah)<br>
[5] Come and witness God’s exploits!<br>
His acts on behalf of people are awesome.<br>
[6] He turned the sea into dry land;<br>
they passed through the river on foot.<br>
Let us rejoice in him there.<br>
[7] He rules by his power forever;<br>
he watches the nations.<br>
Stubborn rebels should not exalt themselves. (Selah)<br>
[8] Praise our God, you nations.<br>
Loudly proclaim his praise.<br>
[9] He preserves our lives<br>
and does not allow our feet to slip.<br>
[10] For you, O God, tested us;<br>
you purified us like refined silver.<br>
[11] You led us into a trap;<br>
you caused us to suffer.<br>
[12] You allowed men to ride over our heads;<br>
we passed through fire and water,<br>
but you brought us out into a wide open place.<br>
[13] I will enter your temple with burnt sacrifices;<br>
I will fulfill the vows I made to you,<br>
[14] which my lips uttered<br>
and my mouth spoke when I was in trouble.<br>
[15] I will offer up to you fattened animals as burnt sacrifices,<br>
along with the smell of sacrificial rams.<br>
I will offer cattle and goats. (Selah)<br>
[16] Come! Listen, all you who are loyal to God.<br>
I will declare what he has done for me.<br>
[17] I cried out to him for help<br>
and praised him with my tongue.<br>
[18] If I had harbored sin in my heart,<br>
the Lord would not have listened.<br>
[19] However, God heard;<br>
he listened to my prayer.<br>
[20] God deserves praise,<br>
for he did not reject my prayer<br>
or abandon his love for me.<br>
## Psalm 67

[1] May God show us his favor and bless us.<br>
May he smile on us. (Selah)<br>
[2] Then those living on earth will know what you are like;<br>
all nations will know how you deliver your people.<br>
[3] Let the nations thank you, O God.<br>
Let all the nations thank you.<br>
[4] Let foreigners rejoice and celebrate.<br>
For you execute justice among the nations,<br>
and govern the people living on earth. (Selah)<br>
[5] Let the nations thank you, O God.<br>
Let all the nations thank you.<br>
[6] The earth yields its crops.<br>
May God, our God, bless us.<br>
[7] May God bless us.<br>
Then all the ends of the earth will give him the honor he deserves.<br>
## Psalm 68

[1] God springs into action.<br>
His enemies scatter;<br>
his adversaries run from him.<br>
[2] As smoke is driven away by the wind, so you drive them away.<br>
As wax melts before fire,<br>
so the wicked are destroyed before God.<br>
[3] But the godly are happy;<br>
they rejoice before God<br>
and are overcome with joy.<br>
[4] Sing to God! Sing praises to his name.<br>
Exalt the one who rides on the clouds.<br>
For the **Lord** is his name.<br>
Rejoice before him.<br>
[5] He is a father to the fatherless<br>
and an advocate for widows.<br>
God rules from his holy dwelling place.<br>
[6] God settles in their own homes those who have been deserted;<br>
he frees prisoners and grants them prosperity.<br>
But sinful rebels live in the desert.<br>
[7] O God, when you lead your people into battle,<br>
when you march through the wastelands, (Selah)<br>
[8] the earth shakes.<br>
Yes, the heavens pour down rain<br>
before God, the God of Sinai,<br>
before God, the God of Israel.<br>
[9] O God, you cause abundant showers to fall on your chosen people.<br>
When they are tired, you sustain them,<br>
[10] for you live among them.<br>
You sustain the oppressed with your good blessings, O God.<br>
[11] The Lord speaks;<br>
many, many women spread the good news.<br>
[12] Kings leading armies run away—they run away!<br>
The lovely lady of the house divides up the loot.<br>
[13] When you lie down among the sheepfolds,<br>
the wings of the dove are covered with silver<br>
and with glittering gold.<br>
[14] When the Sovereign One scatters kings,<br>
let it snow on Zalmon.<br>
[15] The mountain of Bashan is a towering mountain;<br>
the mountain of Bashan is a mountain with many peaks.<br>
[16] Why do you look with envy, O mountains with many peaks,<br>
at the mountain where God has decided to live?<br>
Indeed the **Lord** will live there permanently.<br>
[17] God has countless chariots;<br>
they number in the thousands.<br>
The Lord comes from Sinai in holy splendor.<br>
[18] You ascend on high;<br>
you have taken many captives.<br>
You receive tribute from men,<br>
including even sinful rebels.<br>
Indeed, the **Lord** God lives there.<br>
[19] The Lord deserves praise.<br>
Day after day he carries our burden,<br>
the God who delivers us. (Selah)<br>
[20] Our God is a God who delivers;<br>
the **Lord**, the Sovereign Lord, can rescue from death.<br>
[21] Indeed, God strikes the heads of his enemies,<br>
the hairy foreheads of those who persist in rebellion.<br>
[22] The Lord says,<br>
“I will retrieve them from Bashan.<br>
I will bring them back from the depths of the sea,<br>
[23] so that your feet may stomp in their blood,<br>
and your dogs may eat their portion of the enemies’ corpses.”<br>
[24] They see your processions, O God—<br>
the processions of my God, my king, who marches along in holy splendor.<br>
[25] Singers walk in front;<br>
musicians follow playing their stringed instruments,<br>
in the midst of young women playing tambourines.<br>
[26] In your large assemblies praise God,<br>
the **Lord**, in the assemblies of Israel.<br>
[27] There is little Benjamin, their ruler,<br>
and the princes of Judah in their robes,<br>
along with the princes of Zebulun and the princes of Naphtali.<br>
[28] God has decreed that you will be powerful.<br>
O God, you who have acted on our behalf, demonstrate your power.<br>
[29] Because of your temple in Jerusalem,<br>
kings bring tribute to you.<br>
[30] Sound your battle cry against the wild beast of the reeds,<br>
and the nations that assemble like a herd of calves led by bulls.<br>
They humble themselves and offer gold and silver as tribute.<br>
God scatters the nations that like to do battle.<br>
[31] They come with red cloth from Egypt.<br>
Ethiopia voluntarily offers tribute to God.<br>
[32] O kingdoms of the earth, sing to God.<br>
Sing praises to the Lord, (Selah)<br>
[33] to the one who rides through the sky from ancient times.<br>
Look! He thunders loudly.<br>
[34] Acknowledge God’s power,<br>
his sovereignty over Israel,<br>
and the power he reveals in the skies.<br>
[35] You are awe-inspiring, O God, as you emerge from your holy temple.<br>
It is the God of Israel who gives the people power and strength.<br>
God deserves praise!<br>
## Psalm 69

[1] Deliver me, O God,<br>
for the water has reached my neck.<br>
[2] I sink into the deep mire<br>
where there is no solid ground;<br>
I am in deep water,<br>
and the current overpowers me.<br>
[3] I am exhausted from shouting for help.<br>
My throat is sore;<br>
my eyes grow tired from looking for my God.<br>
[4] Those who hate me without cause<br>
are more numerous than the hairs of my head.<br>
Those who want to destroy me,<br>
my enemies for no reason,<br>
outnumber me.<br>
They make me repay what I did not steal.<br>
[5] O God, you are aware of my foolish sins;<br>
my guilt is not hidden from you.<br>
[6] Let none who rely on you be disgraced because of me,<br>
O Sovereign **Lord** of Heaven’s Armies.<br>
Let none who seek you be ashamed because of me,<br>
O God of Israel.<br>
[7] For I suffer humiliation for your sake<br>
and am thoroughly disgraced.<br>
[8] My own brothers treat me like a stranger;<br>
they act as if I were a foreigner.<br>
[9] Certainly zeal for your house consumes me;<br>
I endure the insults of those who insult you.<br>
[10] I weep and refrain from eating food,<br>
which causes others to insult me.<br>
[11] I wear sackcloth<br>
and they ridicule me.<br>
[12] Those who sit at the city gate gossip about me;<br>
drunkards mock me in their songs.<br>
[13] O **Lord**, may you hear my prayer and be favorably disposed to me.<br>
O God, because of your great loyal love,<br>
answer me with your faithful deliverance.<br>
[14] Rescue me from the mud. Don’t let me sink.<br>
Deliver me from those who hate me,<br>
from the deep water.<br>
[15] Don’t let the current overpower me.<br>
Don’t let the deep swallow me up.<br>
Don’t let the Pit devour me.<br>
[16] Answer me, O **Lord**, for your loyal love is good.<br>
Because of your great compassion, turn toward me.<br>
[17] Do not ignore your servant,<br>
for I am in trouble. Answer me right away.<br>
[18] Come near me and redeem me.<br>
Because of my enemies, rescue me.<br>
[19] You know how I am insulted, humiliated, and disgraced;<br>
you can see all my enemies.<br>
[20] Their insults are painful and make me lose heart;<br>
I look for sympathy, but receive none,<br>
for comforters, but find none.<br>
[21] They put bitter poison into my food,<br>
and to quench my thirst they give me vinegar to drink.<br>
[22] May their dining table become a trap before them.<br>
May it be a snare for that group of friends.<br>
[23] May their eyes be blinded.<br>
Make them shake violently.<br>
[24] Pour out your judgment on them.<br>
May your raging anger overtake them.<br>
[25] May their camp become desolate,<br>
their tents uninhabited.<br>
[26] For they harass the one whom you discipline;<br>
they spread the news about the suffering of those whom you punish.<br>
[27] Hold them accountable for all their sins.<br>
Do not vindicate them.<br>
[28] May their names be deleted from the scroll of the living.<br>
Do not let their names be listed with the godly.<br>
[29] I am oppressed and suffering.<br>
O God, deliver and protect me.<br>
[30] I will sing praises to God’s name.<br>
I will magnify him as I give him thanks.<br>
[31] That will please the **Lord** more than an ox or a bull<br>
with horns and hooves.<br>
[32] The oppressed look on—let them rejoice.<br>
You who seek God, may you be encouraged.<br>
[33] For the **Lord** listens to the needy;<br>
he does not despise his captive people.<br>
[34] Let the heavens and the earth praise him,<br>
along with the seas and everything that swims in them.<br>
[35] For God will deliver Zion<br>
and rebuild the cities of Judah,<br>
and his people will again live in them and possess Zion.<br>
[36] The descendants of his servants will inherit it,<br>
and those who are loyal to him will live in it.<br>
## Psalm 70

[1] O God, please be willing to rescue me.<br>
O **Lord**, hurry and help me.<br>
[2] May those who are trying to take my life<br>
be embarrassed and ashamed.<br>
May those who want to harm me<br>
be turned back and ashamed.<br>
[3] May those who say, “Aha! Aha!”<br>
be driven back and disgraced.<br>
[4] May all those who seek you be happy and rejoice in you.<br>
May those who love to experience your deliverance say continually,<br>
“May God be praised!”<br>
[5] I am oppressed and needy.<br>
O God, hurry to me.<br>
You are my helper and my deliverer.<br>
O **Lord**, do not delay.<br>
## Psalm 71

[1] In you, O **Lord**, I have taken shelter.<br>
Never let me be humiliated.<br>
[2] Vindicate me by rescuing me.<br>
Listen to me. Deliver me.<br>
[3] Be my protector and refuge,<br>
a stronghold where I can be safe.<br>
For you are my high ridge and my stronghold.<br>
[4] My God, rescue me from the power of the wicked,<br>
from the hand of the cruel oppressor.<br>
[5] For you are my hope;<br>
O Sovereign **Lord**, I have trusted in you since I was young.<br>
[6] I have leaned on you since birth;<br>
you pulled me from my mother’s womb.<br>
I praise you continually.<br>
[7] Many are appalled when they see me,<br>
but you are my secure shelter.<br>
[8] I praise you constantly<br>
and speak of your splendor all day long.<br>
[9] Do not reject me in my old age.<br>
When my strength fails, do not abandon me.<br>
[10] For my enemies talk about me;<br>
those waiting for a chance to kill me plot my demise.<br>
[11] They say, “God has abandoned him.<br>
Run and seize him, for there is no one who will rescue him.”<br>
[12] O God, do not remain far away from me.<br>
My God, hurry and help me.<br>
[13] May my accusers be humiliated and defeated.<br>
May those who want to harm me be covered with scorn and disgrace.<br>
[14] As for me, I will wait continually,<br>
and will continue to praise you.<br>
[15] I will tell about your justice,<br>
and all day long proclaim your salvation,<br>
though I cannot fathom its full extent.<br>
[16] I will come and tell about the mighty acts of the Sovereign **Lord**.<br>
I will proclaim your justice—yours alone.<br>
[17] O God, you have taught me since I was young,<br>
and I am still declaring your amazing deeds.<br>
[18] Even when I am old and gray,<br>
O God, do not abandon me,<br>
until I tell the next generation about your strength,<br>
and those coming after me about your power.<br>
[19] Your justice, O God, extends to the skies above;<br>
you have done great things.<br>
O God, who can compare to you?<br>
[20] Though you have allowed me to experience much trouble and distress,<br>
revive me once again.<br>
Bring me up once again from the depths of the earth.<br>
[21] Raise me to a position of great honor.<br>
Turn and comfort me.<br>
[22] I will express my thanks to you with a stringed instrument,<br>
praising your faithfulness, O my God.<br>
I will sing praises to you accompanied by a harp,<br>
O Holy One of Israel.<br>
[23] My lips will shout for joy. Yes, I will sing your praises.<br>
I will praise you when you rescue me.<br>
[24] All day long my tongue will also tell about your justice,<br>
for those who want to harm me will be embarrassed and ashamed.<br>
## Psalm 72

[1] O God, grant the king the ability to make just decisions.<br>
Grant the king’s son the ability to make fair decisions.<br>
[2] Then he will judge your people fairly,<br>
and your oppressed ones equitably.<br>
[3] The mountains will bring news of peace to the people,<br>
and the hills will announce justice.<br>
[4] He will defend the oppressed among the people;<br>
he will deliver the children of the poor<br>
and crush the oppressor.<br>
[5] People will fear you as long as the sun and moon remain in the sky,<br>
for generation after generation.<br>
[6] He will descend like rain on the mown grass,<br>
like showers that drench the earth.<br>
[7] During his days the godly will flourish;<br>
peace will prevail as long as the moon remains in the sky.<br>
[8] May he rule from sea to sea,<br>
and from the Euphrates River to the ends of the earth.<br>
[9] Before him the coastlands will bow down,<br>
and his enemies will lick the dust.<br>
[10] The kings of Tarshish and the coastlands will offer gifts;<br>
the kings of Sheba and Seba will bring tribute.<br>
[11] All kings will bow down to him;<br>
all nations will serve him.<br>
[12] For he will rescue the needy when they cry out for help,<br>
and the oppressed who have no defender.<br>
[13] He will take pity on the poor and needy;<br>
the lives of the needy he will save.<br>
[14] From harm and violence he will defend them;<br>
he will value their lives.<br>
[15] May he live! May they offer him gold from Sheba.<br>
May they continually pray for him.<br>
May they pronounce blessings on him all day long.<br>
[16] May there be an abundance of grain in the earth;<br>
on the tops of the mountains may it sway.<br>
May its fruit trees flourish like the forests of Lebanon.<br>
May its crops be as abundant as the grass of the earth.<br>
[17] May his fame endure.<br>
May his dynasty last as long as the sun remains in the sky.<br>
May they use his name when they formulate their blessings.<br>
May all nations consider him to be favored by God.<br>
[18] The **Lord** God, the God of Israel, deserves praise.<br>
He alone accomplishes amazing things.<br>
[19] His glorious name deserves praise forevermore.<br>
May his majestic splendor fill the whole earth.<br>
We agree! We agree!<br>
[20] This collection of the prayers of David son of Jesse ends here.<br>
## Psalm 73

### Book 3 (Psalms 73-89)

[1] Certainly God is good to Israel,<br>
and to those whose motives are pure.<br>
[2] But as for me, my feet almost slipped;<br>
my feet almost slid out from under me.<br>
[3] For I envied those who are proud,<br>
as I observed the prosperity of the wicked.<br>
[4] For they suffer no pain;<br>
their bodies are strong and well fed.<br>
[5] They are immune to the trouble common to men;<br>
they do not suffer as other men do.<br>
[6] Arrogance is their necklace,<br>
and violence covers them like clothing.<br>
[7] Their prosperity causes them to do wrong;<br>
their thoughts are sinful.<br>
[8] They mock and say evil things;<br>
they proudly threaten violence.<br>
[9] They speak as if they rule in heaven,<br>
and lay claim to the earth.<br>
[10] Therefore they have more than enough food to eat,<br>
and even suck up the water of the sea.<br>
[11] They say, “How does God know what we do?<br>
Is the Most High aware of what goes on?”<br>
[12] Take a good look. This is what the wicked are like,<br>
those who always have it so easy and get richer and richer.<br>
[13] I concluded, “Surely in vain I have kept my motives pure<br>
and maintained a pure lifestyle.<br>
[14] I suffer all day long,<br>
and am punished every morning.”<br>
[15] If I had publicized these thoughts,<br>
I would have betrayed your people.<br>
[16] When I tried to make sense of this,<br>
it was troubling to me.<br>
[17] Then I entered the precincts of God’s temple,<br>
and understood the destiny of the wicked.<br>
[18] Surely you put them in slippery places;<br>
you bring them down to ruin.<br>
[19] How desolate they become in a mere moment.<br>
Terrifying judgments make their demise complete.<br>
[20] They are like a dream after one wakes up.<br>
O Lord, when you awake you will despise them.<br>
[21] Yes, my spirit was bitter,<br>
and my insides felt sharp pain.<br>
[22] I was ignorant and lacked insight;<br>
I was as senseless as an animal before you.<br>
[23] But I am continually with you;<br>
you hold my right hand.<br>
[24] You guide me by your wise advice,<br>
and then you will lead me to a position of honor.<br>
[25] Whom do I have in heaven but you?<br>
On earth there is no one I desire but you.<br>
[26] My flesh and my heart may grow weak,<br>
but God always protects my heart and gives me stability.<br>
[27] Yes, look! Those far from you die;<br>
you destroy everyone who is unfaithful to you.<br>
[28] But as for me, God’s presence is all I need.<br>
I have made the Sovereign **Lord** my shelter,<br>
as I declare all the things you have done.<br>
## Psalm 74

[1] Why, O God, have you permanently rejected us?<br>
Why does your anger burn against the sheep of your pasture?<br>
[2] Remember your people whom you acquired in ancient times,<br>
whom you rescued so they could be your very own nation,<br>
as well as Mount Zion, where you dwell.<br>
[3] Hurry to the permanent ruins,<br>
and to all the damage the enemy has done to the temple.<br>
[4] Your enemies roar in the middle of your sanctuary;<br>
they set up their battle flags.<br>
[5] They invade like lumberjacks<br>
swinging their axes in a thick forest.<br>
[6] And now they are tearing down all its engravings<br>
with axes and crowbars.<br>
[7] They set your sanctuary on fire;<br>
they desecrate your dwelling place by knocking it to the ground.<br>
[8] They say to themselves,<br>
“We will oppress all of them.”<br>
They burn down all the places in the land where people worship God.<br>
[9] We do not see any signs of God’s presence;<br>
there are no longer any prophets,<br>
and we have no one to tell us how long this will last.<br>
[10] How long, O God, will the adversary hurl insults?<br>
Will the enemy blaspheme your name forever?<br>
[11] Why do you remain inactive?<br>
Intervene and destroy him.<br>
[12] But God has been my king from ancient times,<br>
performing acts of deliverance on the earth.<br>
[13] You destroyed the sea by your strength;<br>
you shattered the heads of the sea monster in the water.<br>
[14] You crushed the heads of Leviathan;<br>
you fed him to the people who live along the coast.<br>
[15] You broke open the spring and the stream;<br>
you dried up perpetually flowing rivers.<br>
[16] You established the cycle of day and night;<br>
you put the moon and sun in place.<br>
[17] You set up all the boundaries of the earth;<br>
you created the cycle of summer and winter.<br>
[18] Remember how the enemy hurls insults, O **Lord**,<br>
and how a foolish nation blasphemes your name.<br>
[19] Do not hand the life of your dove over to a wild animal.<br>
Do not continue to disregard the lives of your oppressed people.<br>
[20] Remember your covenant promises,<br>
for the dark regions of the earth are full of places where violence rules.<br>
[21] Do not let the afflicted be turned back in shame.<br>
Let the oppressed and poor praise your name.<br>
[22] Rise up, O God. Defend your honor.<br>
Remember how fools insult you all day long.<br>
[23] Do not disregard what your enemies say,<br>
or the unceasing shouts of those who defy you.<br>
## Psalm 75

[1] We give thanks to you, O God. We give thanks.<br>
You reveal your presence;<br>
people tell about your amazing deeds.<br>
[2] God says,<br>
“At the appointed times,<br>
I judge fairly.<br>
[3] When the earth and all its inhabitants dissolve in fear,<br>
I make its pillars secure.” (Selah)<br>
[4] I say to the proud, “Do not be proud,”<br>
and to the wicked, “Do not be so confident of victory.<br>
[5] Do not be so certain you have won.<br>
Do not speak with your head held so high.<br>
[6] For victory does not come from the east or west,<br>
or from the wilderness.<br>
[7] For God is the judge.<br>
He brings one down and exalts another.<br>
[8] For the **Lord** holds in his hand a cup<br>
full of foaming wine mixed with spices,<br>
and pours it out.<br>
Surely all the wicked of the earth<br>
will slurp it up and drink it to its very last drop.”<br>
[9] As for me, I will continually tell what you have done;<br>
I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.<br>
[10] God says,<br>
“I will bring down all the power of the wicked;<br>
the godly will be victorious.”<br>
## Psalm 76

[1] God has revealed himself in Judah;<br>
in Israel his reputation is great.<br>
[2] He lives in Salem;<br>
he dwells in Zion.<br>
[3] There he shattered the arrows,<br>
the shield, the sword, and the rest of the weapons of war. (Selah)<br>
[4] You shine brightly and reveal your majesty,<br>
as you descend from the hills where you killed your prey.<br>
[5] The bravehearted were plundered;<br>
they “fell asleep.”<br>
All the warriors were helpless.<br>
[6] At the sound of your battle cry, O God of Jacob,<br>
both rider and horse “fell asleep.”<br>
[7] You are awesome! Yes, you!<br>
Who can withstand your intense anger?<br>
[8] From heaven you announced what their punishment would be.<br>
The earth was afraid and silent<br>
[9] when God arose to execute judgment,<br>
and to deliver all the oppressed of the earth. (Selah)<br>
[10] Certainly your angry judgment upon men will bring you praise;<br>
you reveal your anger in full measure.<br>
[11] Make vows to the **Lord** your God and repay them.<br>
Let all those who surround him bring tribute to the awesome one.<br>
[12] He humbles princes;<br>
the kings of the earth regard him as awesome.<br>
## Psalm 77

[1] I will cry out to God and call for help.<br>
I will cry out to God and he will pay attention to me.<br>
[2] In my time of trouble I sought the Lord.<br>
I kept my hand raised in prayer throughout the night.<br>
I refused to be comforted.<br>
[3] I said, “I will remember God while I groan;<br>
I will think about him while my strength leaves me.” (Selah)<br>
[4] You held my eyelids open;<br>
I was troubled and could not speak.<br>
[5] I thought about the days of old,<br>
about ancient times.<br>
[6] I said, “During the night I will remember the song I once sang;<br>
I will think very carefully.”<br>
I tried to make sense of what was happening.<br>
[7] I asked, “Will the Lord reject me forever?<br>
Will he never again show me his favor?<br>
[8] Has his loyal love disappeared forever?<br>
Has his promise failed forever?<br>
[9] Has God forgotten to be merciful?<br>
Has his anger stifled his compassion?” (Selah)<br>
[10] Then I said, “I am sickened by the thought<br>
that the Most High might become inactive.<br>
[11] I will remember the works of the **Lord**.<br>
Yes, I will remember the amazing things you did long ago.<br>
[12] I will think about all you have done;<br>
I will reflect upon your deeds.”<br>
[13] O God, your deeds are extraordinary.<br>
What god can compare to our great God?<br>
[14] You are the God who does amazing things;<br>
you have revealed your strength among the nations.<br>
[15] You delivered your people by your strength —<br>
the children of Jacob and Joseph. (Selah)<br>
[16] The waters saw you, O God,<br>
the waters saw you and trembled.<br>
Yes, the depths of the sea shook with fear.<br>
[17] The clouds poured down rain;<br>
the skies thundered.<br>
Yes, your arrows flashed about.<br>
[18] Your thunderous voice was heard in the wind;<br>
the lightning bolts lit up the world.<br>
The earth trembled and shook.<br>
[19] You walked through the sea;<br>
you passed through the surging waters,<br>
but left no footprints.<br>
[20] You led your people like a flock of sheep,<br>
by the hand of Moses and Aaron.<br>
## Psalm 78

[1] Pay attention, my people, to my instruction.<br>
Listen to the words I speak.<br>
[2] I will sing a song that imparts wisdom;<br>
I will make insightful observations about the past.<br>
[3] What we have heard and learned —<br>
that which our ancestors have told us—<br>
[4] we will not hide from their descendants.<br>
We will tell the next generation<br>
about the **Lord**’s praiseworthy acts,<br>
about his strength and the amazing things he has done.<br>
[5] He established a rule in Jacob;<br>
he set up a law in Israel.<br>
He commanded our ancestors<br>
to make his deeds known to their descendants,<br>
[6] so that the next generation, children yet to be born,<br>
might know about them.<br>
They will grow up and tell their descendants about them.<br>
[7] Then they will place their confidence in God.<br>
They will not forget the works of God,<br>
and they will obey his commands.<br>
[8] Then they will not be like their ancestors,<br>
who were a stubborn and rebellious generation,<br>
a generation that was not committed<br>
and faithful to God.<br>
[9] The Ephraimites were armed with bows,<br>
but they retreated in the day of battle.<br>
[10] They did not keep their covenant with God,<br>
and they refused to obey his law.<br>
[11] They forgot what he had done,<br>
the amazing things he had shown them.<br>
[12] He did amazing things in the sight of their ancestors,<br>
in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.<br>
[13] He divided the sea and led them across it;<br>
he made the water stand in a heap.<br>
[14] He led them with a cloud by day,<br>
and with the light of a fire all night long.<br>
[15] He broke open rocks in the wilderness,<br>
and gave them enough water to fill the depths of the sea.<br>
[16] He caused streams to flow from the rock,<br>
and made the water flow like rivers.<br>
[17] Yet they continued to sin against him,<br>
and rebelled against the Most High in the desert.<br>
[18] They willfully challenged God<br>
by asking for food to satisfy their appetite.<br>
[19] They insulted God, saying,<br>
“Is God really able to give us food in the wilderness?<br>
[20] Yes, he struck a rock and water flowed out;<br>
streams gushed forth.<br>
But can he also give us food?<br>
Will he provide meat for his people?”<br>
[21] When the **Lord** heard this, he was furious.<br>
A fire broke out against Jacob,<br>
and his anger flared up against Israel,<br>
[22] because they did not have faith in God,<br>
and did not trust his ability to deliver them.<br>
[23] He gave a command to the clouds above,<br>
and opened the doors in the sky.<br>
[24] He rained down manna for them to eat;<br>
he gave them the grain of heaven.<br>
[25] Man ate the food of the mighty ones.<br>
He sent them more than enough to eat.<br>
[26] He brought the east wind through the sky,<br>
and by his strength led forth the south wind.<br>
[27] He rained down meat on them like dust,<br>
birds as numerous as the sand on the seashores.<br>
[28] He caused them to fall right in the middle of their camp,<br>
all around their homes.<br>
[29] They ate until they were beyond full;<br>
he gave them what they desired.<br>
[30] They were not yet filled up;<br>
their food was still in their mouths,<br>
[31] when the anger of God flared up against them.<br>
He killed some of the strongest of them;<br>
he brought the young men of Israel to their knees.<br>
[32] Despite all this, they continued to sin,<br>
and did not trust him to do amazing things.<br>
[33] So he caused them to die unsatisfied<br>
and filled with terror.<br>
[34] When he struck them down, they sought his favor;<br>
they turned back and longed for God.<br>
[35] They remembered that God was their protector,<br>
and that God Most High was their deliverer.<br>
[36] But they deceived him with their words,<br>
and lied to him.<br>
[37] They were not really committed to him,<br>
and they were unfaithful to his covenant.<br>
[38] Yet he is compassionate.<br>
He forgives sin and does not destroy.<br>
He often holds back his anger,<br>
and does not stir up his fury.<br>
[39] He remembered that they were made of flesh,<br>
and were like a wind that blows past and does not return.<br>
[40] How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,<br>
and insulted him in the wastelands.<br>
[41] They again challenged God,<br>
and offended the Holy One of Israel.<br>
[42] They did not remember what he had done,<br>
how he delivered them from the enemy,<br>
[43] when he performed his awesome deeds in Egypt,<br>
and his acts of judgment in the region of Zoan.<br>
[44] He turned their rivers into blood,<br>
and they could not drink from their streams.<br>
[45] He sent swarms of biting insects against them,<br>
as well as frogs that overran their land.<br>
[46] He gave their crops to the grasshopper,<br>
the fruit of their labor to the locust.<br>
[47] He destroyed their vines with hail,<br>
and their sycamore-fig trees with driving rain.<br>
[48] He rained hail down on their cattle,<br>
and hurled lightning bolts down on their livestock.<br>
[49] His raging anger lashed out against them.<br>
He sent fury, rage, and trouble<br>
as messengers who bring disaster.<br>
[50] He sent his anger in full force.<br>
He did not spare them from death;<br>
he handed their lives over to destruction.<br>
[51] He struck down all the firstborn in Egypt,<br>
the firstfruits of their reproductive power in the tents of Ham.<br>
[52] Yet he brought out his people like sheep;<br>
he led them through the wilderness like a flock.<br>
[53] He guided them safely along, and they were not afraid;<br>
but the sea covered their enemies.<br>
[54] He brought them to the border of his holy land,<br>
to this mountainous land that his right hand acquired.<br>
[55] He drove the nations out from before them;<br>
he assigned them their tribal allotments<br>
and allowed the tribes of Israel to settle down.<br>
[56] Yet they challenged and defied God Most High,<br>
and did not obey his commands.<br>
[57] They were unfaithful and acted as treacherously as their ancestors;<br>
they were as unreliable as a malfunctioning bow.<br>
[58] They made him angry with their pagan shrines,<br>
and made him jealous with their idols.<br>
[59] God heard and was angry;<br>
he completely rejected Israel.<br>
[60] He abandoned the sanctuary at Shiloh,<br>
the tent where he lived among men.<br>
[61] He allowed the symbol of his strong presence to be captured;<br>
he gave the symbol of his splendor into the hand of the enemy.<br>
[62] He delivered his people over to the sword,<br>
and was angry with his chosen nation.<br>
[63] Fire consumed their young men,<br>
and their virgins remained unmarried.<br>
[64] Their priests fell by the sword,<br>
but their widows did not weep.<br>
[65] But then the Lord awoke from his sleep;<br>
he was like a warrior in a drunken rage.<br>
[66] He drove his enemies back;<br>
he made them a permanent target for insults.<br>
[67] He rejected the tent of Joseph;<br>
he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim.<br>
[68] He chose the tribe of Judah<br>
and Mount Zion, which he loves.<br>
[69] He made his sanctuary as enduring as the heavens above,<br>
as secure as the earth, which he established permanently.<br>
[70] He chose David, his servant,<br>
and took him from the sheepfolds.<br>
[71] He took him away from following the mother sheep,<br>
and made him the shepherd of Jacob, his people,<br>
and of Israel, his chosen nation.<br>
[72] David cared for them with pure motives;<br>
he led them with skill.<br>
## Psalm 79

[1] O God, foreigners have invaded your chosen land;<br>
they have polluted your holy temple<br>
and turned Jerusalem into a heap of ruins.<br>
[2] They have given the corpses of your servants<br>
to the birds of the sky,<br>
the flesh of your loyal followers<br>
to the beasts of the earth.<br>
[3] They have made their blood flow like water<br>
all around Jerusalem, and there is no one to bury them.<br>
[4] We have become an object of disdain to our neighbors;<br>
those who live on our borders taunt and insult us.<br>
[5] How long will this go on, O **Lord**?<br>
Will you stay angry forever?<br>
How long will your rage burn like fire?<br>
[6] Pour out your anger on the nations that do not acknowledge you,<br>
on the kingdoms that do not pray to you.<br>
[7] For they have devoured Jacob<br>
and destroyed his home.<br>
[8] Do not hold us accountable for the sins of earlier generations.<br>
Quickly send your compassion our way,<br>
for we are in serious trouble.<br>
[9] Help us, O God, our deliverer!<br>
For the sake of your glorious reputation, rescue us.<br>
Forgive our sins for the sake of your reputation.<br>
[10] Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?”<br>
Before our very eyes may the shed blood of your servants<br>
be avenged among the nations.<br>
[11] Listen to the painful cries of the prisoners.<br>
Use your great strength to set free those condemned to die.<br>
[12] Pay back our neighbors in full.<br>
May they be insulted the same way they insulted you, O Lord.<br>
[13] Then we, your people, the sheep of your pasture,<br>
will continually thank you.<br>
We will tell coming generations of your praiseworthy acts.<br>
## Psalm 80

[1] O Shepherd of Israel, pay attention,<br>
you who lead Joseph like a flock of sheep.<br>
You who sit enthroned above the cherubim, reveal your splendor.<br>
[2] In the sight of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh reveal your power.<br>
Come and deliver us.<br>
[3] O God, restore us.<br>
Smile on us. Then we will be delivered.<br>
[4] O **Lord** God of Heaven’s Armies,<br>
how long will you remain angry at your people while they pray to you?<br>
[5] You have given them tears as food;<br>
you have made them drink tears by the measure.<br>
[6] You have made our neighbors dislike us,<br>
and our enemies insult us.<br>
[7] O God of Heaven’s Armies, restore us.<br>
Smile on us. Then we will be delivered.<br>
[8] You uprooted a vine from Egypt;<br>
you drove out nations and transplanted it.<br>
[9] You cleared the ground for it;<br>
it took root,<br>
and filled the land.<br>
[10] The mountains were covered by its shadow,<br>
the highest cedars by its branches.<br>
[11] Its branches reached the Mediterranean Sea,<br>
and its shoots the Euphrates River.<br>
[12] Why did you break down its walls,<br>
so that all who pass by pluck its fruit?<br>
[13] The wild boars of the forest ruin it;<br>
the insects of the field feed on it.<br>
[14] O God of Heaven’s Armies, come back.<br>
Look down from heaven and take notice.<br>
Take care of this vine,<br>
[15] the root your right hand planted,<br>
the shoot you made to grow.<br>
[16] It is burned and cut down.<br>
May those who did this die because you are displeased with them.<br>
[17] May you give support to the one you have chosen,<br>
to the one whom you raised up for yourself.<br>
[18] Then we will not turn away from you.<br>
Revive us and we will pray to you.<br>
[19] O **Lord** God of Heaven’s Armies, restore us.<br>
Smile on us. Then we will be delivered.<br>
## Psalm 81

[1] Shout for joy to God, our source of strength!<br>
Shout out to the God of Jacob!<br>
[2] Sing a song and play the tambourine,<br>
the pleasant-sounding harp, and the ten-stringed instrument.<br>
[3] Sound the ram’s horn on the day of the new moon,<br>
and on the day of the full moon when our festival begins.<br>
[4] For observing the festival is a requirement for Israel;<br>
it is an ordinance given by the God of Jacob.<br>
[5] He decreed it as a regulation in Joseph,<br>
when he attacked the land of Egypt.<br>
I heard a voice I did not recognize.<br>
[6] It said: “I removed the burden from his shoulder;<br>
his hands were released from holding the basket.<br>
[7] In your distress you called out and I rescued you.<br>
I answered you from a dark thundercloud.<br>
I tested you at the waters of Meribah. (Selah)<br>
[8] I said, ‘Listen, my people!<br>
I will warn you.<br>
O Israel, if only you would obey me!<br>
[9] There must be no other god among you.<br>
You must not worship a foreign god.<br>
[10] I am the **Lord**, your God,<br>
the one who brought you out of the land of Egypt.<br>
Open your mouth wide and I will fill it.’<br>
[11] But my people did not obey me;<br>
Israel did not submit to me.<br>
[12] I gave them over to their stubborn desires;<br>
they did what seemed right to them.<br>
[13] If only my people would obey me!<br>
If only Israel would keep my commands!<br>
[14] Then I would quickly subdue their enemies,<br>
and attack their adversaries.”<br>
[15] (May those who hate the **Lord** cower in fear before him.<br>
May they be permanently humiliated.)<br>
[16] “I would feed Israel the best wheat,<br>
and would satisfy your appetite with honey from the rocky cliffs.”<br>
## Psalm 82

[1] God stands in the assembly of El;<br>
in the midst of the gods he renders judgment.<br>
[2] He says, “How long will you make unjust legal decisions<br>
and show favoritism to the wicked? (Selah)<br>
[3] Defend the cause of the poor and the fatherless.<br>
Vindicate the oppressed and suffering.<br>
[4] Rescue the poor and needy.<br>
Deliver them from the power of the wicked.<br>
[5] They neither know nor understand.<br>
They stumble around in the dark,<br>
while all the foundations of the earth crumble.<br>
[6] I thought, ‘You are gods;<br>
all of you are sons of the Most High.’<br>
[7] Yet you will die like mortals;<br>
you will fall like all the other rulers.”<br>
[8] Rise up, O God, and execute judgment on the earth!<br>
For you own all the nations.<br>
## Psalm 83

[1] O God, do not be silent.<br>
Do not ignore us. Do not be inactive, O God.<br>
[2] For look, your enemies are making a commotion;<br>
those who hate you are hostile.<br>
[3] They carefully plot against your people,<br>
and make plans to harm the ones you cherish.<br>
[4] They say, “Come on, let’s annihilate them so they are no longer a nation.<br>
Then the name of Israel will be remembered no more.”<br>
[5] Yes, they devise a unified strategy;<br>
they form an alliance against you.<br>
[6] It includes the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites,<br>
Moab and the Hagrites,<br>
[7] Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek,<br>
Philistia and the inhabitants of Tyre.<br>
[8] Even Assyria has allied with them,<br>
lending its strength to the descendants of Lot. (Selah)<br>
[9] Do to them as you did to Midian —<br>
as you did to Sisera and Jabin at the Kishon River.<br>
[10] They were destroyed at Endor;<br>
their corpses were like manure on the ground.<br>
[11] Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,<br>
and all their rulers like Zebah and Zalmunna,<br>
[12] who said, “Let’s take over the pastures of God.”<br>
[13] O my God, make them like dead thistles,<br>
like dead weeds blown away by the wind.<br>
[14] Like the fire that burns down the forest,<br>
or the flames that consume the mountainsides,<br>
[15] chase them with your gale winds,<br>
and terrify them with your windstorm.<br>
[16] Cover their faces with shame,<br>
so they might seek you, O **Lord**.<br>
[17] May they be humiliated and continually terrified.<br>
May they die in shame.<br>
[18] Then they will know that you alone are the **Lord**,<br>
the Most High over all the earth.<br>
## Psalm 84

[1] How lovely is the place where you live,<br>
O **Lord** of Heaven’s Armies!<br>
[2] I desperately want to be<br>
in the courts of the **Lord**’s temple.<br>
My heart and my entire being shout for joy<br>
to the living God.<br>
[3] Even the birds find a home there,<br>
and the swallow builds a nest,<br>
where she can protect her young<br>
near your altars, O **Lord** of Heaven’s Armies,<br>
my King and my God.<br>
[4] How blessed are those who live in your temple<br>
and praise you continually. (Selah)<br>
[5] How blessed are those who find their strength in you,<br>
and long to travel the roads that lead to your temple.<br>
[6] As they pass through the Baca Valley,<br>
he provides a spring for them.<br>
The rain even covers it with pools of water.<br>
[7] They are sustained as they travel along;<br>
each one appears before God in Zion.<br>
[8] O **Lord** God of Heaven’s Armies,<br>
hear my prayer.<br>
Listen, O God of Jacob. (Selah)<br>
[9] O God, take notice of our shield.<br>
Show concern for your chosen king.<br>
[10] Certainly spending just one day in your temple courts is better<br>
than spending a thousand elsewhere.<br>
I would rather stand at the entrance to the temple of my God<br>
than live in the tents of the wicked.<br>
[11] For the **Lord** God is our sovereign protector.<br>
The **Lord** bestows favor and honor;<br>
he withholds no good thing from those who have integrity.<br>
[12] O **Lord** of Heaven’s Armies,<br>
how blessed are those who trust in you.<br>
## Psalm 85

[1] O **Lord**, you showed favor to your land;<br>
you restored the well-being of Jacob.<br>
[2] You pardoned the wrongdoing of your people;<br>
you forgave all their sin. (Selah)<br>
[3] You withdrew all your fury;<br>
you turned back from your raging anger.<br>
[4] Restore us, O God our deliverer.<br>
Do not be displeased with us.<br>
[5] Will you stay mad at us forever?<br>
Will you remain angry throughout future generations?<br>
[6] Will you not revive us once more?<br>
Then your people will rejoice in you.<br>
[7] O **Lord**, show us your loyal love.<br>
Bestow on us your deliverance.<br>
[8] I will listen to what God the **Lord** says.<br>
For he will make peace with his people, his faithful followers.<br>
Yet they must not return to their foolish ways.<br>
[9] Certainly his loyal followers will soon experience his deliverance;<br>
then his splendor will again appear in our land.<br>
[10] Loyal love and faithfulness meet;<br>
deliverance and peace greet each other with a kiss.<br>
[11] Faithfulness grows from the ground,<br>
and deliverance looks down from the sky.<br>
[12] Yes, the **Lord** will bestow his good blessings,<br>
and our land will yield its crops.<br>
[13] Deliverance goes before him,<br>
and prepares a pathway for him.<br>
## Psalm 86

[1] Listen, O **Lord**. Answer me.<br>
For I am oppressed and needy.<br>
[2] Protect me, for I am loyal.<br>
You are my God; deliver your servant who trusts in you.<br>
[3] Have mercy on me, O Lord,<br>
for I cry out to you all day long.<br>
[4] Make your servant glad,<br>
for to you, O Lord, I pray.<br>
[5] Certainly, O Lord, you are kind and forgiving,<br>
and show great faithfulness to all who cry out to you.<br>
[6] O **Lord**, hear my prayer.<br>
Pay attention to my plea for mercy.<br>
[7] In my time of trouble I cry out to you,<br>
for you will answer me.<br>
[8] None can compare to you among the gods, O Lord.<br>
Your exploits are incomparable.<br>
[9] All the nations, whom you created,<br>
will come and worship you, O Lord.<br>
They will honor your name.<br>
[10] For you are great and do amazing things.<br>
You alone are God.<br>
[11] O **Lord**, teach me how you want me to live.<br>
Then I will obey your commands.<br>
Make me wholeheartedly committed to you.<br>
[12] O Lord, my God, I will give you thanks with my whole heart.<br>
I will honor your name continually.<br>
[13] For you will extend your great loyal love to me,<br>
and will deliver my life from the depths of Sheol.<br>
[14] O God, arrogant men attack me;<br>
a gang of ruthless men, who do not respect you, seek my life.<br>
[15] But you, O Lord, are a compassionate and merciful God.<br>
You are patient and demonstrate great loyal love and faithfulness.<br>
[16] Turn toward me and have mercy on me.<br>
Give your servant your strength.<br>
Deliver this son of your female servant.<br>
[17] Show me evidence of your favor.<br>
Then those who hate me will see it and be ashamed,<br>
for you, O **Lord**, will help me and comfort me.<br>
## Psalm 87

[1] The **Lord**’s city is in the holy hills.<br>
[2] The **Lord** loves the gates of Zion<br>
more than all the dwelling places of Jacob.<br>
[3] People say wonderful things about you,<br>
O city of God. (Selah)<br>
[4] I mention Rahab and Babylon to my followers.<br>
Here are Philistia and Tyre, along with Ethiopia.<br>
It is said of them, “This one was born there.”<br>
[5] But it is said of Zion’s residents,<br>
“Each one of these was born in her,<br>
and the Most High makes her secure.”<br>
[6] The **Lord** writes in the census book of the nations,<br>
“This one was born there.” (Selah)<br>
[7] As for the singers, as well as the pipers—<br>
all of them sing within your walls.<br>
## Psalm 88

[1] O **Lord** God who delivers me,<br>
by day I cry out<br>
and at night I pray before you.<br>
[2] Listen to my prayer.<br>
Pay attention to my cry for help.<br>
[3] For my life is filled with troubles,<br>
and I am ready to enter Sheol.<br>
[4] They treat me like those who descend into the grave.<br>
I am like a helpless man,<br>
[5] adrift among the dead,<br>
like corpses lying in the grave,<br>
whom you remember no more,<br>
and who are cut off from your power.<br>
[6] You place me in the lowest regions of the Pit,<br>
in the dark places, in the watery depths.<br>
[7] Your anger bears down on me,<br>
and you overwhelm me with all your waves. (Selah)<br>
[8] You cause those who know me to keep their distance;<br>
you make me an appalling sight to them.<br>
I am trapped and cannot get free.<br>
[9] My eyes grow weak because of oppression.<br>
I call out to you, O **Lord**, all day long;<br>
I spread out my hands in prayer to you.<br>
[10] Do you accomplish amazing things for the dead?<br>
Do the departed spirits rise up and give you thanks? (Selah)<br>
[11] Is your loyal love proclaimed in the grave,<br>
or your faithfulness in the place of the dead?<br>
[12] Are your amazing deeds experienced in the dark region,<br>
or your deliverance in the land of oblivion?<br>
[13] As for me, I cry out to you, O **Lord**;<br>
in the morning my prayer confronts you.<br>
[14] O **Lord**, why do you reject me,<br>
and pay no attention to me?<br>
[15] I am oppressed and have been on the verge of death since my youth.<br>
I have been subjected to your horrors and am numb with pain.<br>
[16] Your anger overwhelms me;<br>
your terrors destroy me.<br>
[17] They surround me like water all day long;<br>
they join forces and encircle me.<br>
[18] You cause my friends and neighbors to keep their distance;<br>
those who know me leave me alone in the darkness.<br>
## Psalm 89

[1] I will sing continually about the **Lord**’s faithful deeds;<br>
to future generations I will proclaim your faithfulness.<br>
[2] For I say, “Loyal love is permanently established;<br>
in the skies you set up your faithfulness.”<br>
[3] The **Lord** said,<br>
“I have made a covenant with my chosen one;<br>
I have made a promise on oath to David, my servant:<br>
[4] ‘I will give you an eternal dynasty<br>
and establish your throne throughout future generations.’” (Selah)<br>
[5] O **Lord**, the heavens praise your amazing deeds,<br>
as well as your faithfulness in the angelic assembly.<br>
[6] For who in the skies can compare to the **Lord**?<br>
Who is like the **Lord** among the heavenly beings,<br>
[7] a God who is honored in the great angelic assembly,<br>
and more awesome than all who surround him?<br>
[8] O **Lord** God of Heaven’s Armies!<br>
Who is strong like you, O **Lord**?<br>
Your faithfulness surrounds you.<br>
[9] You rule over the proud sea.<br>
When its waves surge, you calm them.<br>
[10] You crushed the Proud One and killed it;<br>
with your strong arm you scattered your enemies.<br>
[11] The heavens belong to you, as does the earth.<br>
You made the world and all it contains.<br>
[12] You created the north and the south.<br>
Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name.<br>
[13] Your arm is powerful,<br>
your hand strong,<br>
your right hand victorious.<br>
[14] Equity and justice are the foundation of your throne.<br>
Loyal love and faithfulness characterize your rule.<br>
[15] How blessed are the people who worship you!<br>
O **Lord**, they experience your favor.<br>
[16] They rejoice in your name all day long,<br>
and are vindicated by your justice.<br>
[17] For you give them splendor and strength.<br>
By your favor we are victorious.<br>
[18] For our shield belongs to the **Lord**,<br>
our king to the Holy One of Israel.<br>
[19] Then you spoke through a vision to your faithful followers and said:<br>
“I have placed a young hero over a warrior;<br>
I have raised up a young man from the people.<br>
[20] I have discovered David, my servant.<br>
With my holy oil I have anointed him as king.<br>
[21] My hand will support him,<br>
and my arm will strengthen him.<br>
[22] No enemy will be able to exact tribute from him;<br>
a violent oppressor will not be able to humiliate him.<br>
[23] I will crush his enemies before him;<br>
I will strike down those who hate him.<br>
[24] He will experience my faithfulness and loyal love,<br>
and by my name he will win victories.<br>
[25] I will place his hand over the sea,<br>
his right hand over the rivers.<br>
[26] He will call out to me,<br>
‘You are my father, my God, and the protector who delivers me.’<br>
[27] I will appoint him to be my firstborn son,<br>
the most exalted of the earth’s kings.<br>
[28] I will always extend my loyal love to him,<br>
and my covenant with him is secure.<br>
[29] I will give him an eternal dynasty,<br>
and make his throne as enduring as the skies above.<br>
[30] If his sons reject my law<br>
and disobey my regulations,<br>
[31] if they break my rules<br>
and do not keep my commandments,<br>
[32] I will punish their rebellion by beating them with a club,<br>
their sin by inflicting them with bruises.<br>
[33] But I will not remove my loyal love from him,<br>
nor be unfaithful to my promise.<br>
[34] I will not break my covenant<br>
or go back on what I promised.<br>
[35] Once and for all I have vowed by my own holiness,<br>
I will never deceive David.<br>
[36] His dynasty will last forever.<br>
His throne will endure before me, like the sun;<br>
[37] it will remain stable, like the moon.<br>
His throne will endure like the skies.” (Selah)<br>
[38] But you have spurned and rejected him;<br>
you are angry with your chosen king.<br>
[39] You have repudiated your covenant with your servant;<br>
you have thrown his crown to the ground.<br>
[40] You have broken down all his walls;<br>
you have made his strongholds a heap of ruins.<br>
[41] All who pass by have robbed him;<br>
he has become an object of disdain to his neighbors.<br>
[42] You have allowed his adversaries to be victorious,<br>
and all his enemies to rejoice.<br>
[43] You turn back his sword from the adversary,<br>
and have not sustained him in battle.<br>
[44] You have brought to an end his splendor,<br>
and have knocked his throne to the ground.<br>
[45] You have cut short his youth,<br>
and have covered him with shame. (Selah)<br>
[46] How long, O **Lord**, will this last?<br>
Will you remain hidden forever?<br>
Will your anger continue to burn like fire?<br>
[47] Take note of my brief lifespan.<br>
Why do you make all people so mortal?<br>
[48] No man can live on without experiencing death,<br>
or deliver his life from the power of Sheol. (Selah)<br>
[49] Where are your earlier faithful deeds, O Lord,<br>
the ones performed in accordance with your reliable oath to David?<br>
[50] Take note, O Lord, of the way your servants are taunted,<br>
and of how I must bear so many insults from people.<br>
[51] Your enemies, O **Lord**, hurl insults;<br>
they insult your chosen king as they dog his footsteps.<br>
[52] The **Lord** deserves praise forevermore!<br>
We agree! We agree!<br>
## Psalm 90

### Book 4 (Psalms 90-106)

[1] O Lord, you have been our protector through all generations.<br>
[2] Even before the mountains came into existence,<br>
or you brought the world into being,<br>
you were the eternal God.<br>
[3] You make mankind return to the dust,<br>
and say, “Return, O people.”<br>
[4] Yes, in your eyes a thousand years<br>
are like yesterday that quickly passes,<br>
or like one of the divisions of the nighttime.<br>
[5] You bring their lives to an end and they “fall asleep.”<br>
In the morning they are like the grass that sprouts up:<br>
[6] In the morning it glistens and sprouts up;<br>
at evening time it withers and dries up.<br>
[7] Yes, we are consumed by your anger;<br>
we are terrified by your wrath.<br>
[8] You are aware of our sins;<br>
you even know about our hidden sins.<br>
[9] Yes, throughout all our days we experience your raging fury;<br>
the years of our lives pass quickly, like a sigh.<br>
[10] The days of our lives add up to seventy years,<br>
or eighty, if one is especially strong.<br>
But even one’s best years are marred by trouble and oppression.<br>
Yes, they pass quickly and we fly away.<br>
[11] Who can really fathom the intensity of your anger?<br>
Your raging fury causes people to fear you.<br>
[12] So teach us to consider our mortality,<br>
so that we might live wisely.<br>
[13] Turn back toward us, O **Lord**.<br>
How long must this suffering last?<br>
Have pity on your servants.<br>
[14] Satisfy us in the morning with your loyal love.<br>
Then we will shout for joy and be happy all our days.<br>
[15] Make us happy in proportion to the days you have afflicted us,<br>
in proportion to the years we have experienced trouble.<br>
[16] May your servants see your work.<br>
May their sons see your majesty.<br>
[17] May our Sovereign God extend his favor to us.<br>
Make our endeavors successful.<br>
Yes, make them successful.<br>
## Psalm 91

[1] As for you, the one who lives in the shelter of the Most High,<br>
and resides in the protective shadow of the Sovereign One —<br>
[2] I say this about the **Lord**, my shelter and my stronghold,<br>
my God in whom I trust—<br>
[3] he will certainly rescue you from the snare of the hunter<br>
and from the destructive plague.<br>
[4] He will shelter you with his wings;<br>
you will find safety under his wings.<br>
His faithfulness is like a shield or a protective wall.<br>
[5] You need not fear the terrors of the night,<br>
the arrow that flies by day,<br>
[6] the plague that stalks in the darkness,<br>
or the disease that ravages at noon.<br>
[7] Though a thousand may fall beside you,<br>
and a multitude on your right side,<br>
it will not reach you.<br>
[8] Certainly you will see it with your very own eyes—<br>
you will see the wicked paid back.<br>
[9] For you have taken refuge in the **Lord**,<br>
my shelter, the Most High.<br>
[10] No harm will overtake you;<br>
no illness will come near your home.<br>
[11] For he will order his angels<br>
to protect you in all you do.<br>
[12] They will lift you up in their hands,<br>
so you will not slip and fall on a stone.<br>
[13] You will subdue a lion and a snake;<br>
you will trample underfoot a young lion and a serpent.<br>
[14] The **Lord** says,<br>
“Because he is devoted to me, I will deliver him;<br>
I will protect him because he is loyal to me.<br>
[15] When he calls out to me, I will answer him.<br>
I will be with him when he is in trouble;<br>
I will rescue him and bring him honor.<br>
[16] I will satisfy him with long life,<br>
and will let him see my salvation.”<br>
## Psalm 92

[1] It is fitting to thank the **Lord**,<br>
and to sing praises to your name, O Most High.<br>
[2] It is fitting to proclaim your loyal love in the morning,<br>
and your faithfulness during the night,<br>
[3] to the accompaniment of a ten-stringed instrument and a lyre,<br>
to the accompaniment of the meditative tone of the harp.<br>
[4] For you, O **Lord**, have made me happy by your work.<br>
I will sing for joy because of what you have done.<br>
[5] How great are your works, O **Lord**!<br>
Your plans are very intricate!<br>
[6] The spiritually insensitive do not recognize this;<br>
the fool does not understand this.<br>
[7] When the wicked sprout up like grass,<br>
and all the evildoers glisten,<br>
it is so that they may be annihilated.<br>
[8] But you, O **Lord**, reign forever.<br>
[9] Indeed, look at your enemies, O **Lord**.<br>
Indeed, look at how your enemies perish.<br>
All the evildoers are scattered.<br>
[10] You exalt my horn like that of a wild ox.<br>
I am covered with fresh oil.<br>
[11] I gloat in triumph over those who tried to ambush me;<br>
I hear the defeated cries of the evil foes who attacked me.<br>
[12] The godly grow like a palm tree;<br>
they grow high like a cedar in Lebanon.<br>
[13] Planted in the **Lord**’s house,<br>
they grow in the courts of our God.<br>
[14] They bear fruit even when they are old;<br>
they are filled with vitality and have many leaves.<br>
[15] So they proclaim that the **Lord**, my Protector,<br>
is just and never unfair.<br>
## Psalm 93

[1] The **Lord** reigns.<br>
He is robed in majesty.<br>
The **Lord** is robed;<br>
he wears strength around his waist.<br>
Indeed, the world is established; it cannot be moved.<br>
[2] Your throne has been secure from ancient times;<br>
you have always been king.<br>
[3] The waves roar, O **Lord**,<br>
the waves roar,<br>
the waves roar and crash.<br>
[4] Above the sound of the surging water,<br>
and the mighty waves of the sea,<br>
the **Lord** sits enthroned in majesty.<br>
[5] The rules you set down are completely reliable.<br>
Holiness aptly adorns your house, O **Lord**, forever.<br>
## Psalm 94

[1] O **Lord**, the God who avenges!<br>
O God who avenges, reveal your splendor.<br>
[2] Rise up, O judge of the earth.<br>
Pay back the proud.<br>
[3] O **Lord**, how long will the wicked,<br>
how long will the wicked celebrate?<br>
[4] They spew out threats and speak defiantly;<br>
all the evildoers boast.<br>
[5] O **Lord**, they crush your people;<br>
they oppress the nation that belongs to you.<br>
[6] They kill the widow and the resident foreigner,<br>
and they murder the fatherless.<br>
[7] Then they say, “The **Lord** does not see this;<br>
the God of Jacob does not take notice of it.”<br>
[8] Take notice of this, you ignorant people.<br>
You fools, when will you ever understand?<br>
[9] Does the one who makes the human ear not hear?<br>
Does the one who forms the human eye not see?<br>
[10] Does the one who disciplines the nations not punish?<br>
He is the one who imparts knowledge to human beings!<br>
[11] The **Lord** knows that peoples’ thoughts<br>
are morally bankrupt.<br>
[12] How blessed is the one whom you instruct, O **Lord**,<br>
the one whom you teach from your law,<br>
[13] in order to protect him from times of trouble,<br>
until the wicked are destroyed.<br>
[14] Certainly the **Lord** does not forsake his people;<br>
he does not abandon the nation that belongs to him.<br>
[15] For justice will prevail,<br>
and all the morally upright will be vindicated.<br>
[16] Who will rise up to defend me against the wicked?<br>
Who will stand up for me against the evildoers?<br>
[17] If the **Lord** had not helped me,<br>
I would soon have dwelt in the silence of death.<br>
[18] If I say, “My foot is slipping,”<br>
your loyal love, O **Lord**, supports me.<br>
[19] When worries threaten to overwhelm me,<br>
your soothing touch makes me happy.<br>
[20] Cruel rulers are not your allies,<br>
those who make oppressive laws.<br>
[21] They conspire against the blameless,<br>
and condemn to death the innocent.<br>
[22] But the **Lord** will protect me,<br>
and my God will shelter me.<br>
[23] He will pay them back for their sin.<br>
He will destroy them because of their evil;<br>
the **Lord** our God will destroy them.<br>
## Psalm 95

[1] Come, let us sing for joy to the **Lord**.<br>
Let us shout out praises to our Protector who delivers us.<br>
[2] Let us enter his presence with thanksgiving.<br>
Let us shout out to him in celebration.<br>
[3] For the **Lord** is a great God,<br>
a great king who is superior to all gods.<br>
[4] The depths of the earth are in his hand,<br>
and the mountain peaks belong to him.<br>
[5] The sea is his, for he made it.<br>
His hands formed the dry land.<br>
[6] Come, let us bow down and worship.<br>
Let us kneel before the **Lord**, our Creator.<br>
[7] For he is our God;<br>
we are the people of his pasture,<br>
the sheep he owns.<br>
Today, if only you would obey him.<br>
[8] He says, “Do not be stubborn like they were at Meribah,<br>
like they were that day at Massah in the wilderness,<br>
[9] where your ancestors challenged my authority,<br>
and tried my patience, even though they had seen my work.<br>
[10] For forty years I was continually disgusted with that generation,<br>
and I said, ‘These people desire to go astray;<br>
they do not obey my commands.’<br>
[11] So I made a vow in my anger,<br>
‘They will never enter into the resting place I had set aside for them.’”<br>
## Psalm 96

[1] Sing to the **Lord** a new song.<br>
Sing to the **Lord**, all the earth.<br>
[2] Sing to the **Lord**. Praise his name.<br>
Announce every day how he delivers.<br>
[3] Tell the nations about his splendor.<br>
Tell all the nations about his amazing deeds.<br>
[4] For the **Lord** is great and certainly worthy of praise;<br>
he is more awesome than all gods.<br>
[5] For all the gods of the nations are worthless,<br>
but the **Lord** made the sky.<br>
[6] Majestic splendor emanates from him;<br>
his sanctuary is firmly established and beautiful.<br>
[7] Ascribe to the **Lord**, O families of the nations,<br>
ascribe to the **Lord** splendor and strength.<br>
[8] Ascribe to the **Lord** the splendor he deserves.<br>
Bring an offering and enter his courts.<br>
[9] Worship the **Lord** in holy attire.<br>
Tremble before him, all the earth.<br>
[10] Say among the nations, “The **Lord** reigns!<br>
The world is established; it cannot be moved.<br>
He judges the nations fairly.”<br>
[11] Let the sky rejoice, and the earth be happy.<br>
Let the sea and everything in it shout.<br>
[12] Let the fields and everything in them celebrate.<br>
Then let the trees of the forest shout with joy<br>
[13] before the **Lord**, for he comes.<br>
For he comes to judge the earth.<br>
He judges the world fairly,<br>
and the nations in accordance with his justice.<br>
## Psalm 97

[1] The **Lord** reigns.<br>
Let the earth be happy.<br>
Let the many coastlands rejoice.<br>
[2] Dark clouds surround him;<br>
equity and justice are the foundation of his throne.<br>
[3] Fire goes before him;<br>
on every side it burns up his enemies.<br>
[4] His lightning bolts light up the world;<br>
the earth sees and trembles.<br>
[5] The mountains melt like wax before the **Lord**,<br>
before the Lord of the whole earth.<br>
[6] The sky declares his justice,<br>
and all the nations see his splendor.<br>
[7] All who worship idols are ashamed,<br>
those who boast about worthless idols.<br>
All the gods bow down before him.<br>
[8] Zion hears and rejoices,<br>
the towns of Judah are happy,<br>
because of your judgments, O **Lord**.<br>
[9] For you, O **Lord**, are the Most High over the whole earth;<br>
you are elevated high above all gods.<br>
[10] You who love the **Lord**, hate evil!<br>
He protects the lives of his faithful followers;<br>
he delivers them from the power of the wicked.<br>
[11] The godly bask in the light;<br>
the morally upright experience joy.<br>
[12] You godly ones, rejoice in the **Lord**.<br>
Give thanks to his holy name.<br>
## Psalm 98

[1] Sing to the **Lord** a new song,<br>
for he performs amazing deeds.<br>
His right hand and his mighty arm<br>
accomplish deliverance.<br>
[2] The **Lord** demonstrates his power to deliver;<br>
in the sight of the nations he reveals his justice.<br>
[3] He remains loyal and faithful to the family of Israel.<br>
All the ends of the earth see our God deliver us.<br>
[4] Shout out praises to the **Lord**, all the earth.<br>
Break out in a joyful shout and sing!<br>
[5] Sing to the **Lord** accompanied by a harp,<br>
accompanied by a harp and the sound of music.<br>
[6] With trumpets and the blaring of the ram’s horn,<br>
shout out praises before the king, the **Lord**.<br>
[7] Let the sea and everything in it shout,<br>
along with the world and those who live in it.<br>
[8] Let the rivers clap their hands!<br>
Let the mountains sing in unison<br>
[9] before the **Lord**.<br>
For he comes to judge the earth.<br>
He judges the world fairly,<br>
and the nations in a just manner.<br>
## Psalm 99

[1] The **Lord** reigns!<br>
The nations tremble.<br>
He sits enthroned above the cherubim;<br>
the earth shakes.<br>
[2] The **Lord** is elevated in Zion;<br>
he is exalted over all the nations.<br>
[3] Let them praise your great and awesome name.<br>
He is holy!<br>
[4] The king is strong;<br>
he loves justice.<br>
You ensure that legal decisions will be made fairly;<br>
you promote justice and equity in Jacob.<br>
[5] Praise the **Lord** our God.<br>
Worship before his footstool.<br>
He is holy!<br>
[6] Moses and Aaron were among his priests;<br>
Samuel was one of those who prayed to him.<br>
They prayed to the **Lord** and he answered them.<br>
[7] He spoke to them from a pillar of cloud;<br>
they obeyed his regulations and the ordinance he gave them.<br>
[8] O **Lord** our God, you answered them.<br>
They found you to be a forgiving God,<br>
but also one who punished their sinful deeds.<br>
[9] Praise the **Lord** our God!<br>
Worship on his holy hill,<br>
for the **Lord** our God is holy.<br>
## Psalm 100

[1] Shout out praises to the **Lord**, all the earth!<br>
[2] Worship the **Lord** with joy.<br>
Enter his presence with joyful singing.<br>
[3] Acknowledge that the **Lord** is God.<br>
He made us and we belong to him,<br>
we are his people, the sheep of his pasture.<br>
[4] Enter his gates with thanksgiving,<br>
and his courts with praise.<br>
Give him thanks.<br>
Praise his name.<br>
[5] For the **Lord** is good.<br>
His loyal love endures,<br>
and he is faithful through all generations.<br>
## Psalm 101

[1] I will sing about loyalty and justice.<br>
To you, O **Lord**, I will sing praises.<br>
[2] I will walk in the way of integrity.<br>
When will you come to me?<br>
I will conduct my business with integrity in the midst of my palace.<br>
[3] I will not even consider doing what is dishonest.<br>
I hate doing evil;<br>
I will have no part of it.<br>
[4] I will have nothing to do with a perverse person;<br>
I will not permit evil.<br>
[5] I will destroy anyone who slanders his neighbor in secret.<br>
I will not tolerate anyone who has a haughty demeanor and an arrogant attitude.<br>
[6] I will favor the honest people of the land,<br>
and allow them to live with me.<br>
Those who walk in the way of integrity will attend me.<br>
[7] Deceitful people will not live in my palace.<br>
Liars will not be welcome in my presence.<br>
[8] Each morning I will destroy all the wicked people in the land,<br>
and remove all evildoers from the city of the **Lord**.<br>
## Psalm 102

[1] O **Lord**, hear my prayer.<br>
Pay attention to my cry for help.<br>
[2] Do not ignore me in my time of trouble.<br>
Listen to me.<br>
When I call out to you, quickly answer me.<br>
[3] For my days go up in smoke,<br>
and my bones are charred as in a fireplace.<br>
[4] My heart is parched and withered like grass,<br>
for I am unable to eat food.<br>
[5] Because of the anxiety that makes me groan,<br>
my bones protrude from my skin.<br>
[6] I am like an owl in the wilderness;<br>
I am like a screech owl among the ruins.<br>
[7] I stay awake;<br>
I am like a solitary bird on a roof.<br>
[8] All day long my enemies taunt me;<br>
those who mock me use my name in their curses.<br>
[9] For I eat ashes as if they were bread,<br>
and mix my drink with my tears,<br>
[10] because of your anger and raging fury.<br>
Indeed, you pick me up and throw me away.<br>
[11] My days are coming to an end,<br>
and I am withered like grass.<br>
[12] But you, O **Lord**, rule forever,<br>
and your reputation endures.<br>
[13] You will rise up and have compassion on Zion.<br>
For it is time to have mercy on her,<br>
for the appointed time has come.<br>
[14] Indeed, your servants take delight in her stones,<br>
and feel compassion for the dust of her ruins.<br>
[15] The nations will respect the reputation of the **Lord**,<br>
and all the kings of the earth will respect his splendor,<br>
[16] when the **Lord** rebuilds Zion,<br>
and reveals his splendor,<br>
[17] when he responds to the prayer of the destitute,<br>
and does not reject their request.<br>
[18] The account of his intervention will be recorded for future generations;<br>
people yet to be born will praise the **Lord**.<br>
[19] For he will look down from his sanctuary above;<br>
from heaven the **Lord** will look toward earth,<br>
[20] in order to hear the painful cries of the prisoners,<br>
and to set free those condemned to die,<br>
[21] so they may proclaim the name of the **Lord** in Zion,<br>
and praise him in Jerusalem,<br>
[22] when the nations gather together,<br>
and the kingdoms pay tribute to the **Lord**.<br>
[23] He has taken away my strength in the middle of life;<br>
he has cut short my days.<br>
[24] I say, “O my God, please do not take me away in the middle of my life.<br>
You endure through all generations.<br>
[25] In earlier times you established the earth;<br>
the skies are your handiwork.<br>
[26] They will perish,<br>
but you will endure.<br>
They will wear out like a garment;<br>
like clothes you will remove them and they will disappear.<br>
[27] But you remain;<br>
your years do not come to an end.<br>
[28] The children of your servants will settle down here,<br>
and their descendants will live securely in your presence.”<br>
## Psalm 103

[1] Praise the **Lord**, O my soul.<br>
With all that is within me, praise his holy name.<br>
[2] Praise the **Lord**, O my soul.<br>
Do not forget all his kind deeds.<br>
[3] He is the one who forgives all your sins,<br>
who heals all your diseases,<br>
[4] who delivers your life from the Pit,<br>
who crowns you with his loyal love and compassion,<br>
[5] who satisfies your life with good things,<br>
so your youth is renewed like an eagle’s.<br>
[6] The **Lord** does what is fair,<br>
and executes justice for all the oppressed.<br>
[7] The **Lord** revealed his faithful acts to Moses,<br>
his deeds to the Israelites.<br>
[8] The **Lord** is compassionate and merciful;<br>
he is patient and demonstrates great loyal love.<br>
[9] He does not always accuse,<br>
and does not stay angry.<br>
[10] He does not deal with us as our sins deserve;<br>
he does not repay us as our misdeeds deserve.<br>
[11] For as the skies are high above the earth,<br>
so his loyal love towers over his faithful followers.<br>
[12] As far as the eastern horizon is from the west,<br>
so he removes the guilt of our rebellious actions from us.<br>
[13] As a father has compassion on his children,<br>
so the **Lord** has compassion on his faithful followers.<br>
[14] For he knows what we are made of;<br>
he realizes we are made of clay.<br>
[15] A person’s life is like grass.<br>
Like a flower in the field it flourishes,<br>
[16] but when the hot wind blows, it disappears,<br>
and one can no longer even spot the place where it once grew.<br>
[17] But the **Lord** continually shows loyal love to his faithful followers,<br>
and is faithful to their descendants,<br>
[18] to those who keep his covenant,<br>
who are careful to obey his commands.<br>
[19] The **Lord** has established his throne in heaven;<br>
his kingdom extends over everything.<br>
[20] Praise the **Lord**, you angels of his,<br>
you powerful warriors who carry out his decrees<br>
and obey his orders.<br>
[21] Praise the **Lord**, all you warriors of his,<br>
you servants of his who carry out his desires.<br>
[22] Praise the **Lord**, all that he has made,<br>
in all the regions of his kingdom.<br>
Praise the **Lord**, O my soul.<br>
## Psalm 104

[1] Praise the **Lord**, O my soul!<br>
O **Lord** my God, you are magnificent.<br>
You are robed in splendor and majesty.<br>
[2] He covers himself with light as if it were a garment.<br>
He stretches out the skies like a tent curtain,<br>
[3] and lays the beams of the upper rooms of his palace on the rain clouds.<br>
He makes the clouds his chariot,<br>
and travels on the wings of the wind.<br>
[4] He makes the winds his messengers,<br>
and the flaming fire his attendant.<br>
[5] He established the earth on its foundations;<br>
it will never be moved.<br>
[6] The watery deep covered it like a garment;<br>
the waters reached above the mountains.<br>
[7] Your shout made the waters retreat;<br>
at the sound of your thunderous voice they hurried off—<br>
[8] as the mountains rose up,<br>
and the valleys went down—<br>
to the place you appointed for them.<br>
[9] You set up a boundary for them that they could not cross,<br>
so that they would not cover the earth again.<br>
[10] He turns springs into streams;<br>
they flow between the mountains.<br>
[11] They provide water for all the animals in the field;<br>
the wild donkeys quench their thirst.<br>
[12] The birds of the sky live beside them;<br>
they chirp among the bushes.<br>
[13] He waters the mountains from the upper rooms of his palace;<br>
the earth is full of the fruit you cause to grow.<br>
[14] He provides grass for the cattle,<br>
and crops for people to cultivate,<br>
so they can produce food from the ground,<br>
[15] as well as wine that makes people glad,<br>
and olive oil to make their faces shine,<br>
as well as bread that sustains them.<br>
[16] The trees of the **Lord** receive all the rain they need,<br>
the cedars of Lebanon that he planted,<br>
[17] where the birds make nests,<br>
near the evergreens in which the herons live.<br>
[18] The wild goats live in the high mountains;<br>
the rock badgers find safety in the cliffs.<br>
[19] He made the moon to mark the months,<br>
and the sun sets according to a regular schedule.<br>
[20] You make it dark and night comes,<br>
during which all the beasts of the forest prowl around.<br>
[21] The lions roar for prey,<br>
seeking their food from God.<br>
[22] When the sun rises, they withdraw<br>
and sleep in their dens.<br>
[23] People then go out to do their work,<br>
and they labor until evening.<br>
[24] How many living things you have made, O **Lord**!<br>
You have exhibited great skill in making all of them;<br>
the earth is full of the living things you have made.<br>
[25] Over here is the deep, wide sea,<br>
which teems with innumerable swimming creatures,<br>
living things both small and large.<br>
[26] The ships travel there,<br>
and over here swims the whale you made to play in it.<br>
[27] All your creatures wait for you<br>
to provide them with food on a regular basis.<br>
[28] You give food to them and they receive it;<br>
you open your hand and they are filled with food.<br>
[29] When you ignore them, they panic.<br>
When you take away their life’s breath,<br>
they die and return to dust.<br>
[30] When you send your life-giving breath, they are created,<br>
and you replenish the surface of the ground.<br>
[31] May the splendor of the **Lord** endure.<br>
May the **Lord** find pleasure in the living things he has made.<br>
[32] He looks down on the earth and it shakes;<br>
he touches the mountains and they start to smolder.<br>
[33] I will sing to the **Lord** as long as I live;<br>
I will sing praise to my God as long as I exist.<br>
[34] May my thoughts be pleasing to him.<br>
I will rejoice in the **Lord**.<br>
[35] May sinners disappear from the earth,<br>
and the wicked vanish.<br>
Praise the **Lord**, O my soul.<br>
Praise the **Lord**.<br>
## Psalm 105

[1] Give thanks to the **Lord**.<br>
Call on his name.<br>
Make known his accomplishments among the nations.<br>
[2] Sing to him.<br>
Make music to him.<br>
Tell about all his miraculous deeds.<br>
[3] Boast about his holy name.<br>
Let the hearts of those who seek the **Lord** rejoice.<br>
[4] Seek the **Lord** and the strength he gives.<br>
Seek his presence continually.<br>
[5] Recall the miraculous deeds he performed,<br>
his mighty acts and the judgments he decreed,<br>
[6] O children of Abraham, God’s servant,<br>
you descendants of Jacob, God’s chosen ones.<br>
[7] He is the **Lord** our God;<br>
he carries out judgment throughout the earth.<br>
[8] He always remembers his covenantal decree,<br>
the promise he made to a thousand generations—<br>
[9] the promise he made to Abraham,<br>
the promise he made by oath to Isaac.<br>
[10] He gave it to Jacob as a decree,<br>
to Israel as a lasting promise,<br>
[11] saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan<br>
as the portion of your inheritance.”<br>
[12] When they were few in number,<br>
just a very few, and resident foreigners within it,<br>
[13] they wandered from nation to nation,<br>
and from one kingdom to another.<br>
[14] He let no one oppress them;<br>
he disciplined kings for their sake,<br>
[15] saying, “Don’t touch my chosen ones.<br>
Don’t harm my prophets.”<br>
[16] He called down a famine upon the earth;<br>
he cut off all the food supply.<br>
[17] He sent a man ahead of them —<br>
Joseph was sold as a servant.<br>
[18] The shackles hurt his feet;<br>
his neck was placed in an iron collar,<br>
[19] until the time when his prediction came true.<br>
The **Lord**’s word proved him right.<br>
[20] The king authorized his release;<br>
the ruler of nations set him free.<br>
[21] He put him in charge of his palace,<br>
and made him manager of all his property,<br>
[22] giving him authority to imprison his officials<br>
and to teach his advisers.<br>
[23] Israel moved to Egypt;<br>
Jacob lived for a time in the land of Ham.<br>
[24] The **Lord** made his people very fruitful,<br>
and made them more numerous than their enemies.<br>
[25] He caused the Egyptians to hate his people,<br>
and to mistreat his servants.<br>
[26] He sent his servant Moses,<br>
and Aaron, whom he had chosen.<br>
[27] They executed his miraculous signs among them,<br>
and his amazing deeds in the land of Ham.<br>
[28] He made it dark;<br>
Moses and Aaron did not disobey his orders.<br>
[29] He turned the Egyptians’ water into blood,<br>
and killed their fish.<br>
[30] Their land was overrun by frogs,<br>
which even got into the rooms of their kings.<br>
[31] He ordered flies to come;<br>
gnats invaded their whole territory.<br>
[32] He sent hail along with the rain;<br>
there was lightning in their land.<br>
[33] He destroyed their vines and fig trees,<br>
and broke the trees throughout their territory.<br>
[34] He ordered locusts to come,<br>
innumerable grasshoppers.<br>
[35] They ate all the vegetation in their land,<br>
and devoured the crops of their fields.<br>
[36] He struck down all the firstborn in their land,<br>
the firstfruits of their reproductive power.<br>
[37] He brought his people out enriched with silver and gold;<br>
none of his tribes stumbled.<br>
[38] Egypt was happy when they left,<br>
for they were afraid of them.<br>
[39] He spread out a cloud for a cover,<br>
and provided a fire to light up the night.<br>
[40] They asked for food, and he sent quail;<br>
he satisfied them with food from the sky.<br>
[41] He opened up a rock and water flowed out;<br>
a river ran through dry regions.<br>
[42] Yes, he remembered the sacred promise<br>
he made to Abraham his servant.<br>
[43] When he led his people out, they rejoiced;<br>
his chosen ones shouted with joy.<br>
[44] He handed the territory of nations over to them,<br>
and they took possession of what other peoples had produced,<br>
[45] so that they might keep his commands<br>
and obey his laws.<br>
Praise the **Lord**.<br>
## Psalm 106

[1] Praise the **Lord**.<br>
Give thanks to the **Lord**, for he is good,<br>
and his loyal love endures.<br>
[2] Who can adequately recount the **Lord**’s mighty acts,<br>
or relate all his praiseworthy deeds?<br>
[3] How blessed are those who promote justice,<br>
and do what is right all the time.<br>
[4] Remember me, O **Lord**, when you show favor to your people.<br>
Pay attention to me, when you deliver,<br>
[5] so I may see the prosperity of your chosen ones,<br>
rejoice along with your nation,<br>
and boast along with the people who belong to you.<br>
[6] We have sinned like our ancestors;<br>
we have done wrong, we have done evil.<br>
[7] Our ancestors in Egypt failed to appreciate your miraculous deeds.<br>
They failed to remember your many acts of loyal love,<br>
and they rebelled at the sea, by the Red Sea.<br>
[8] Yet he delivered them for the sake of his reputation,<br>
that he might reveal his power.<br>
[9] He shouted at the Red Sea and it dried up;<br>
he led them through the deep water as if it were a desert.<br>
[10] He delivered them from the power of the one who hated them,<br>
and rescued them from the power of the enemy.<br>
[11] The water covered their enemies;<br>
not even one of them survived.<br>
[12] They believed his promises;<br>
they sang praises to him.<br>
[13] They quickly forgot what he had done;<br>
they did not wait for his instructions.<br>
[14] In the wilderness they had an insatiable craving for meat;<br>
they challenged God in the wastelands.<br>
[15] He granted their request,<br>
then struck them with a disease.<br>
[16] In the camp they resented Moses,<br>
and Aaron, the **Lord**’s holy priest.<br>
[17] The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan;<br>
it engulfed the group led by Abiram.<br>
[18] Fire burned their group;<br>
the flames scorched the wicked.<br>
[19] They made an image of a calf at Horeb,<br>
and worshiped a metal idol.<br>
[20] They traded their majestic God<br>
for the image of an ox that eats grass.<br>
[21] They rejected the God who delivered them,<br>
the one who performed great deeds in Egypt,<br>
[22] amazing feats in the land of Ham,<br>
mighty acts by the Red Sea.<br>
[23] He threatened to destroy them,<br>
but Moses, his chosen one, interceded with him<br>
and turned back his destructive anger.<br>
[24] They rejected the fruitful land;<br>
they did not believe his promise.<br>
[25] They grumbled in their tents;<br>
they did not obey the **Lord**.<br>
[26] So he made a solemn vow<br>
that he would make them die in the wilderness,<br>
[27] make their descendants die among the nations,<br>
and scatter them among foreign lands.<br>
[28] They worshiped Baal of Peor,<br>
and ate sacrifices offered to the dead.<br>
[29] They made the **Lord** angry by their actions,<br>
and a plague broke out among them.<br>
[30] Phinehas took a stand and intervened,<br>
and the plague subsided.<br>
[31] This was credited to Phinehas as a righteous act<br>
for all generations to come.<br>
[32] They made him angry by the waters of Meribah,<br>
and Moses suffered because of them,<br>
[33] for they aroused his temper,<br>
and he spoke rashly.<br>
[34] They did not destroy the nations,<br>
as the **Lord** had commanded them to do.<br>
[35] They mixed in with the nations<br>
and learned their ways.<br>
[36] They worshiped their idols,<br>
which became a snare to them.<br>
[37] They sacrificed their sons and daughters to demons.<br>
[38] They shed innocent blood—<br>
the blood of their sons and daughters,<br>
whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan.<br>
The land was polluted by bloodshed.<br>
[39] They were defiled by their deeds,<br>
and unfaithful in their actions.<br>
[40] So the **Lord** was angry with his people<br>
and despised the people who belonged to him.<br>
[41] He handed them over to the nations,<br>
and those who hated them ruled over them.<br>
[42] Their enemies oppressed them;<br>
they were subject to their authority.<br>
[43] Many times he delivered them,<br>
but they had a rebellious attitude,<br>
and degraded themselves by their sin.<br>
[44] Yet he took notice of their distress,<br>
when he heard their cry for help.<br>
[45] He remembered his covenant with them,<br>
and relented because of his great loyal love.<br>
[46] He caused all their conquerors<br>
to have pity on them.<br>
[47] Deliver us, O **Lord**, our God.<br>
Gather us from among the nations.<br>
Then we will give thanks to your holy name,<br>
and boast about your praiseworthy deeds.<br>
[48] The **Lord** God of Israel deserves praise,<br>
in the future and forevermore.<br>
Let all the people say, “We agree! Praise the **Lord**!”<br>
## Psalm 107

### Book 5 (Psalms 107-150)

[1] Give thanks to the **Lord**, for he is good,<br>
and his loyal love endures.<br>
[2] Let those delivered by the **Lord** speak out,<br>
those whom he delivered from the power of the enemy,<br>
[3] and gathered from foreign lands,<br>
from east and west,<br>
from north and south.<br>
[4] They wandered through the wilderness, in a wasteland;<br>
they found no road to a city in which to live.<br>
[5] They were hungry and thirsty;<br>
they fainted from exhaustion.<br>
[6] They cried out to the **Lord** in their distress;<br>
he delivered them from their troubles.<br>
[7] He led them on a level road,<br>
that they might find a city in which to live.<br>
[8] Let them give thanks to the **Lord** for his loyal love,<br>
and for the amazing things he has done for people.<br>
[9] For he has satisfied those who thirst,<br>
and those who hunger he has filled with food.<br>
[10] They sat in utter darkness,<br>
bound in painful iron chains,<br>
[11] because they had rebelled against God’s commands,<br>
and rejected the instructions of the Most High.<br>
[12] So he used suffering to humble them;<br>
they stumbled and no one helped them up.<br>
[13] They cried out to the **Lord** in their distress;<br>
he delivered them from their troubles.<br>
[14] He brought them out of the utter darkness,<br>
and tore off their shackles.<br>
[15] Let them give thanks to the **Lord** for his loyal love,<br>
and for the amazing things he has done for people.<br>
[16] For he shattered the bronze gates,<br>
and hacked through the iron bars.<br>
[17] They acted like fools in their rebellious ways,<br>
and suffered because of their sins.<br>
[18] They lost their appetite for all food,<br>
and they drew near the gates of death.<br>
[19] They cried out to the **Lord** in their distress;<br>
he delivered them from their troubles.<br>
[20] He sent them an assuring word and healed them;<br>
he rescued them from the pits where they were trapped.<br>
[21] Let them give thanks to the **Lord** for his loyal love,<br>
and for the amazing things he has done for people.<br>
[22] Let them present thank offerings,<br>
and loudly proclaim what he has done.<br>
[23] Some traveled on the sea in ships,<br>
and carried cargo over the vast waters.<br>
[24] They witnessed the acts of the **Lord**,<br>
his amazing feats on the deep water.<br>
[25] He gave the order for a windstorm,<br>
and it stirred up the waves of the sea.<br>
[26] They reached up to the sky,<br>
then dropped into the depths.<br>
The sailors’ strength left them because the danger was so great.<br>
[27] They swayed and staggered like drunks,<br>
and all their skill proved ineffective.<br>
[28] They cried out to the **Lord** in their distress;<br>
he delivered them from their troubles.<br>
[29] He calmed the storm,<br>
and the waves grew silent.<br>
[30] The sailors rejoiced because the waves grew quiet,<br>
and he led them to the harbor they desired.<br>
[31] Let them give thanks to the **Lord** for his loyal love,<br>
and for the amazing things he has done for people.<br>
[32] Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people.<br>
Let them praise him in the place where the leaders preside.<br>
[33] He turned streams into a desert,<br>
springs of water into arid land,<br>
[34] and a fruitful land into a barren place,<br>
because of the sin of its inhabitants.<br>
[35] As for his people, he turned a desert into a pool of water,<br>
and a dry land into springs of water.<br>
[36] He allowed the hungry to settle there,<br>
and they established a city in which to live.<br>
[37] They cultivated fields,<br>
and planted vineyards,<br>
which yielded a harvest of fruit.<br>
[38] He blessed them so that they became very numerous.<br>
He would not allow their cattle to decrease in number.<br>
[39] As for their enemies, they decreased in number and were beaten down,<br>
because of painful distress and suffering.<br>
[40] He would pour contempt upon princes,<br>
and he made them wander in a wasteland with no road.<br>
[41] Yet he protected the needy from oppression,<br>
and cared for his families like a flock of sheep.<br>
[42] When the godly see this, they rejoice,<br>
and every sinner shuts his mouth.<br>
[43] Whoever is wise, let him take note of these things.<br>
Let them consider the **Lord**’s acts of loyal love.<br>
## Psalm 108

[1] I am determined, O God.<br>
I will sing and praise you with my whole heart.<br>
[2] Awake, O stringed instrument and harp.<br>
I will wake up at dawn.<br>
[3] I will give you thanks before the nations, O **Lord**.<br>
I will sing praises to you before foreigners.<br>
[4] For your loyal love extends beyond the sky,<br>
and your faithfulness reaches the clouds.<br>
[5] Rise up above the sky, O God.<br>
May your splendor cover the whole earth.<br>
[6] Deliver by your power and answer me,<br>
so that the ones you love may be safe.<br>
[7] God has spoken in his sanctuary:<br>
“I will triumph! I will parcel out Shechem;<br>
the Valley of Sukkoth I will measure off.<br>
[8] Gilead belongs to me,<br>
as does Manasseh.<br>
Ephraim is my helmet,<br>
Judah my royal scepter.<br>
[9] Moab is my washbasin.<br>
I will make Edom serve me.<br>
I will shout in triumph over Philistia.”<br>
[10] Who will lead me into the fortified city?<br>
Who will bring me to Edom?<br>
[11] Have you not rejected us, O God?<br>
O God, you do not go into battle with our armies.<br>
[12] Give us help against the enemy,<br>
for any help men might offer is futile.<br>
[13] By God’s power we will conquer;<br>
he will trample down our enemies.<br>
## Psalm 109

[1] O God whom I praise, do not ignore me.<br>
[2] For they say cruel and deceptive things to me;<br>
they lie to me.<br>
[3] They surround me and say hateful things;<br>
they attack me for no reason.<br>
[4] They repay my love with accusations,<br>
but I continue to pray.<br>
[5] They repay me evil for good,<br>
and hate for love.<br>
[6] Appoint an evil man to testify against him.<br>
May an accuser stand at his right side.<br>
[7] When he is judged, he will be found guilty.<br>
Then his prayer will be regarded as sinful.<br>
[8] May his days be few.<br>
May another take his job.<br>
[9] May his children be fatherless,<br>
and his wife a widow.<br>
[10] May his children roam around begging,<br>
asking for handouts as they leave their ruined home.<br>
[11] May the creditor seize all he owns.<br>
May strangers loot his property.<br>
[12] May no one show him kindness.<br>
May no one have compassion on his fatherless children.<br>
[13] May his descendants be cut off.<br>
May the memory of them be wiped out by the time the next generation arrives.<br>
[14] May his ancestors’ sins be remembered by the **Lord**.<br>
May his mother’s sin not be forgotten.<br>
[15] May the **Lord** be constantly aware of them,<br>
and cut off the memory of his children from the earth.<br>
[16] For he never bothered to show kindness;<br>
he harassed the oppressed and needy,<br>
and killed the disheartened.<br>
[17] He loved to curse others, so those curses have come upon him.<br>
He had no desire to bless anyone, so he has experienced no blessings.<br>
[18] He made cursing a way of life,<br>
so curses poured into his stomach like water<br>
and seeped into his bones like oil.<br>
[19] May a curse attach itself to him, like a garment one puts on,<br>
or a belt one wears continually.<br>
[20] May the **Lord** repay my accusers in this way,<br>
those who say evil things about me.<br>
[21] O Sovereign **Lord**,<br>
intervene on my behalf for the sake of your reputation.<br>
Because your loyal love is good, deliver me.<br>
[22] For I am oppressed and needy,<br>
and my heart beats violently within me.<br>
[23] I am fading away like a shadow at the end of the day;<br>
I am shaken off like a locust.<br>
[24] I am so starved my knees shake;<br>
I have turned into skin and bones.<br>
[25] I am disdained by them.<br>
When they see me, they shake their heads.<br>
[26] Help me, O **Lord** my God.<br>
Because you are faithful to me, deliver me.<br>
[27] Then they will realize this is your work,<br>
and that you, **Lord**, have accomplished it.<br>
[28] They curse, but you will bless.<br>
When they attack, they will be humiliated,<br>
but your servant will rejoice.<br>
[29] My accusers will be covered with shame,<br>
and draped in humiliation as if it were a robe.<br>
[30] I will thank the **Lord** profusely.<br>
In the middle of a crowd I will praise him,<br>
[31] because he stands at the right hand of the needy,<br>
to deliver him from those who threaten his life.<br>
## Psalm 110

[1] Here is the **Lord**’s proclamation to my lord:<br>
“Sit down at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool.”<br>
[2] The **Lord** extends your dominion from Zion.<br>
Rule in the midst of your enemies.<br>
[3] Your people willingly follow you when you go into battle.<br>
On the holy hills at sunrise the dew of your youth belongs to you.<br>
[4] The **Lord** makes this promise on oath and will not revoke it:<br>
“You are an eternal priest after the pattern of Melchizedek.”<br>
[5] O Lord, at your right hand<br>
he strikes down kings in the day he unleashes his anger.<br>
[6] He executes judgment against the nations.<br>
He fills the valleys with corpses;<br>
he shatters their heads over the vast battlefield.<br>
[7] From the stream along the road he drinks;<br>
then he lifts up his head.<br>
## Psalm 111

[1] Praise the **Lord**!<br>
I will give thanks to the **Lord** with my whole heart,<br>
in the assembly of the godly and the congregation.<br>
[2] The **Lord**’s deeds are great,<br>
eagerly awaited by all who desire them.<br>
[3] His work is majestic and glorious,<br>
and his faithfulness endures forever.<br>
[4] He does amazing things that will be remembered;<br>
the **Lord** is merciful and compassionate.<br>
[5] He gives food to his faithful followers;<br>
he always remembers his covenant.<br>
[6] He announced that he would do mighty deeds for his people,<br>
giving them a land that belonged to other nations.<br>
[7] His acts are characterized by faithfulness and justice;<br>
all his precepts are reliable.<br>
[8] They are forever firm,<br>
and should be faithfully and properly carried out.<br>
[9] He delivered his people;<br>
he ordained that his covenant be observed forever.<br>
His name is holy and awesome.<br>
[10] To obey the **Lord** is the fundamental principle for wise living;<br>
all who carry out his precepts acquire good moral insight.<br>
He will receive praise forever.<br>
## Psalm 112

[1] Praise the **Lord**!<br>
How blessed is the one who obeys the **Lord**,<br>
who takes great delight in keeping his commands.<br>
[2] His descendants will be powerful on the earth;<br>
the godly will be blessed.<br>
[3] His house contains wealth and riches;<br>
his integrity endures.<br>
[4] In the darkness a light shines for the godly,<br>
for each one who is merciful, compassionate, and just.<br>
[5] It goes well for the one who generously lends money,<br>
and conducts his business honestly.<br>
[6] For he will never be shaken;<br>
others will always remember one who is just.<br>
[7] He does not fear bad news.<br>
He is confident; he trusts in the **Lord**.<br>
[8] His resolve is firm; he will not succumb to fear<br>
before he looks in triumph on his enemies.<br>
[9] He generously gives to the needy;<br>
his integrity endures.<br>
He will be vindicated and honored.<br>
[10] When the wicked see this, they will worry;<br>
they will grind their teeth in frustration and melt away.<br>
The desire of the wicked will perish.<br>
## Psalm 113

[1] Praise the **Lord**.<br>
Praise, you servants of the **Lord**,<br>
praise the name of the **Lord**.<br>
[2] May the **Lord**’s name be praised<br>
now and forevermore.<br>
[3] From east to west<br>
the **Lord**’s name is deserving of praise.<br>
[4] The **Lord** is exalted over all the nations;<br>
his splendor reaches beyond the sky.<br>
[5] Who can compare to the **Lord** our God,<br>
who sits on a high throne?<br>
[6] He bends down to look<br>
at the sky and the earth.<br>
[7] He raises the poor from the dirt,<br>
and lifts up the needy from the garbage pile,<br>
[8] that he might seat him with princes,<br>
with the princes of his people.<br>
[9] He makes the barren woman of the family<br>
a happy mother of children.<br>
Praise the **Lord**.<br>
## Psalm 114

[1] When Israel left Egypt,<br>
when the family of Jacob left a foreign nation behind,<br>
[2] Judah became his sanctuary,<br>
Israel his kingdom.<br>
[3] The sea looked and fled;<br>
the Jordan River turned back.<br>
[4] The mountains skipped like rams,<br>
the hills like lambs.<br>
[5] Why do you flee, O sea?<br>
Why do you turn back, O Jordan River?<br>
[6] Why do you skip like rams, O mountains,<br>
like lambs, O hills?<br>
[7] Tremble, O earth, before the Lord—<br>
before the God of Jacob,<br>
[8] who turned a rock into a pool of water,<br>
a hard rock into springs of water.<br>
## Psalm 115

[1] Not to us, O **Lord**, not to us,<br>
but to your name bring honor,<br>
for the sake of your loyal love and faithfulness.<br>
[2] Why should the nations say,<br>
“Where is their God?”<br>
[3] Our God is in heaven.<br>
He does whatever he pleases.<br>
[4] Their idols are made of silver and gold—<br>
they are man-made.<br>
[5] They have mouths, but cannot speak,<br>
eyes, but cannot see,<br>
[6] ears, but cannot hear,<br>
noses, but cannot smell,<br>
[7] hands, but cannot touch,<br>
feet, but cannot walk.<br>
They cannot even clear their throats.<br>
[8] Those who make them will end up like them,<br>
as will everyone who trusts in them.<br>
[9] O Israel, trust in the **Lord**.<br>
He is their deliverer and protector.<br>
[10] O family of Aaron, trust in the **Lord**.<br>
He is their deliverer and protector.<br>
[11] You loyal followers of the **Lord**, trust in the **Lord**.<br>
He is their deliverer and protector.<br>
[12] The **Lord** takes notice of us; he will bless —<br>
he will bless the family of Israel,<br>
he will bless the family of Aaron.<br>
[13] He will bless his loyal followers,<br>
both young and old.<br>
[14] May he increase your numbers,<br>
yours and your children’s.<br>
[15] May you be blessed by the **Lord**,<br>
the Creator of heaven and earth.<br>
[16] The heavens belong to the **Lord**,<br>
but the earth he has given to mankind.<br>
[17] The dead do not praise the **Lord**,<br>
nor do any of those who descend into the silence of death.<br>
[18] But we will praise the **Lord**<br>
now and forevermore.<br>
Praise the **Lord**!<br>
## Psalm 116

[1] I love the **Lord**<br>
because he heard my plea for mercy,<br>
[2] and listened to me.<br>
As long as I live, I will call to him when I need help.<br>
[3] The ropes of death tightened around me,<br>
the snares of Sheol confronted me.<br>
I was confronted with trouble and sorrow.<br>
[4] I called on the name of the **Lord**,<br>
“Please, **Lord**, rescue my life!”<br>
[5] The **Lord** is merciful and fair;<br>
our God is compassionate.<br>
[6] The **Lord** protects the untrained;<br>
I was in serious trouble and he delivered me.<br>
[7] Rest once more, my soul,<br>
for the **Lord** has vindicated you.<br>
[8] Yes, **Lord**, you rescued my life from death,<br>
kept my eyes from tears<br>
and my feet from stumbling.<br>
[9] I will serve the **Lord**<br>
in the land of the living.<br>
[10] I had faith when I said,<br>
“I am severely oppressed.”<br>
[11] I rashly declared,<br>
“All men are liars.”<br>
[12] How can I repay the **Lord**<br>
for all his acts of kindness to me?<br>
[13] I will celebrate my deliverance,<br>
and call on the name of the **Lord**.<br>
[14] I will fulfill my vows to the **Lord**<br>
before all his people.<br>
[15] The **Lord** values<br>
the lives of his faithful followers.<br>
[16] Yes, **Lord**! I am indeed your servant;<br>
I am your servant, the son of your female servant.<br>
You saved me from death.<br>
[17] I will present a thank offering to you,<br>
and call on the name of the **Lord**.<br>
[18] I will fulfill my vows to the **Lord**<br>
before all his people,<br>
[19] in the courts of the **Lord**’s temple,<br>
in your midst, O Jerusalem.<br>
Praise the **Lord**!<br>
## Psalm 117

[1] Praise the **Lord**, all you nations.<br>
Applaud him, all you foreigners.<br>
[2] For his loyal love towers over us,<br>
and the **Lord**’s faithfulness endures.<br>
Praise the **Lord**.<br>
## Psalm 118

[1] Give thanks to the **Lord**, for he is good,<br>
and his loyal love endures.<br>
[2] Let Israel say,<br>
“Yes, his loyal love endures.”<br>
[3] Let the family of Aaron say,<br>
“Yes, his loyal love endures.”<br>
[4] Let the loyal followers of the **Lord** say,<br>
“Yes, his loyal love endures.”<br>
[5] In my distress I cried out to the **Lord**.<br>
The **Lord** answered me and put me in a wide open place.<br>
[6] The **Lord** is on my side; I am not afraid.<br>
What can people do to me?<br>
[7] The **Lord** is on my side as my helper.<br>
I look in triumph on those who hate me.<br>
[8] It is better to take shelter in the **Lord**<br>
than to trust in people.<br>
[9] It is better to take shelter in the **Lord**<br>
than to trust in princes.<br>
[10] All the nations surrounded me.<br>
Indeed, in the name of the **Lord** I pushed them away.<br>
[11] They surrounded me, yes, they surrounded me.<br>
Indeed, in the name of the **Lord** I pushed them away.<br>
[12] They surrounded me like bees.<br>
But they disappeared as quickly as a fire among thorns.<br>
Indeed, in the name of the **Lord** I pushed them away.<br>
[13] “You aggressively attacked me and tried to knock me down,<br>
but the **Lord** helped me.<br>
[14] The **Lord** gives me strength and protects me;<br>
he has become my deliverer.”<br>
[15] They celebrate deliverance in the tents of the godly.<br>
The **Lord**’s right hand conquers.<br>
[16] The **Lord**’s right hand gives victory;<br>
the **Lord**’s right hand conquers.<br>
[17] I will not die, but live,<br>
and I will proclaim what the **Lord** has done.<br>
[18] The **Lord** severely punished me,<br>
but he did not hand me over to death.<br>
[19] Open for me the gates of the just king’s temple.<br>
I will enter through them and give thanks to the **Lord**.<br>
[20] This is the **Lord**’s gate—<br>
the godly enter through it.<br>
[21] I will give you thanks, for you answered me,<br>
and have become my deliverer.<br>
[22] The stone that the builders discarded<br>
has become the cornerstone.<br>
[23] This is the **Lord**’s work.<br>
We consider it amazing!<br>
[24] This is the day the **Lord** has brought about.<br>
We will be happy and rejoice in it.<br>
[25] Please, **Lord**, deliver!<br>
Please, **Lord**, grant us success!<br>
[26] May the one who comes in the name of the **Lord** be blessed.<br>
We will pronounce blessings on you in the **Lord**’s temple.<br>
[27] The **Lord** is God, and he has delivered us.<br>
Tie the offering with ropes<br>
to the horns of the altar.<br>
[28] You are my God, and I will give you thanks.<br>
You are my God and I will praise you.<br>
[29] Give thanks to the **Lord**, for he is good<br>
and his loyal love endures.<br>

## Psalm 120

[1] In my distress I cried out<br>
to the **Lord** and he answered me.<br>
[2] I said, “O **Lord**, rescue me<br>
from those who lie with their lips<br>
and those who deceive with their tongues.<br>
[3] How will he severely punish you,<br>
you deceptive talker?<br>
[4] Here’s how! With the sharp arrows of warriors,<br>
with arrowheads forged over the hot coals.<br>
[5] How miserable I am.<br>
For I have lived temporarily in Meshech;<br>
I have resided among the tents of Kedar.<br>
[6] For too long I have had to reside<br>
with those who hate peace.<br>
[7] I am committed to peace,<br>
but when I speak, they want to make war.<br>
## Psalm 121

[1] I look up toward the hills.<br>
From where does my help come?<br>
[2] My help comes from the **Lord**,<br>
the Creator of heaven and earth.<br>
[3] May he not allow your foot to slip.<br>
May your Protector not sleep.<br>
[4] Look! Israel’s Protector<br>
does not sleep or slumber.<br>
[5] The **Lord** is your protector;<br>
the **Lord** is the shade at your right hand.<br>
[6] The sun will not harm you by day,<br>
or the moon by night.<br>
[7] The **Lord** will protect you from all harm;<br>
he will protect your life.<br>
[8] The **Lord** will protect you in all you do,<br>
now and forevermore.<br>
## Psalm 122

[1] I was glad because they said to me,<br>
“We will go to the **Lord**’s temple.”<br>
[2] Our feet are standing<br>
inside your gates, O Jerusalem.<br>
[3] Jerusalem is a city designed<br>
to accommodate an assembly.<br>
[4] The tribes go up there,<br>
the tribes of the **Lord**,<br>
where it is required that Israel<br>
give thanks to the name of the **Lord**.<br>
[5] Indeed, the leaders sit there on thrones and make legal decisions,<br>
on the thrones of the house of David.<br>
[6] Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.<br>
May those who love her prosper.<br>
[7] May there be peace inside your defenses,<br>
and prosperity inside your fortresses.<br>
[8] For the sake of my brothers and my neighbors<br>
I will say, “May there be peace in you.”<br>
[9] For the sake of the temple of the **Lord** our God<br>
I will pray for you to prosper.<br>
## Psalm 123

[1] I look up toward you,<br>
the one enthroned in heaven.<br>
[2] Look, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master,<br>
as the eyes of a female servant look to the hand of her mistress,<br>
so our eyes will look to the **Lord**, our God, until he shows us favor.<br>
[3] Show us favor, O **Lord**, show us favor!<br>
For we have had our fill of humiliation, and then some.<br>
[4] We have had our fill<br>
of the taunts of the self-assured,<br>
of the contempt of the proud.<br>
## Psalm 124

[1] “If the **Lord** had not been on our side”—<br>
let Israel say this.—<br>
[2] if the **Lord** had not been on our side,<br>
when men attacked us,<br>
[3] they would have swallowed us alive,<br>
when their anger raged against us.<br>
[4] The water would have overpowered us;<br>
the current would have overwhelmed us.<br>
[5] The raging water<br>
would have overwhelmed us.<br>
[6] The **Lord** deserves praise,<br>
for he did not hand us over as prey to their teeth.<br>
[7] We escaped with our lives, like a bird from a hunter’s snare.<br>
The snare broke, and we escaped.<br>
[8] Our deliverer is the **Lord**,<br>
the Creator of heaven and earth.<br>
## Psalm 125

[1] Those who trust in the **Lord** are like Mount Zion,<br>
which cannot be moved and will endure forever.<br>
[2] As the mountains surround Jerusalem,<br>
so the **Lord** surrounds his people,<br>
now and forevermore.<br>
[3] Indeed, the scepter of a wicked king will not settle<br>
upon the allotted land of the godly.<br>
Otherwise the godly<br>
might do what is wrong.<br>
[4] Do good, O **Lord**, to those who are good,<br>
to the morally upright.<br>
[5] As for those who are bent on traveling a sinful path,<br>
may the **Lord** remove them, along with those who behave wickedly.<br>
May Israel experience peace.<br>
## Psalm 126

[1] When the **Lord** restored the well-being of Zion,<br>
we thought we were dreaming.<br>
[2] At that time we laughed loudly<br>
and shouted for joy.<br>
At that time the nations said,<br>
“The **Lord** has accomplished great things for these people.”<br>
[3] The **Lord** did indeed accomplish great things for us.<br>
We were happy.<br>
[4] O **Lord**, restore our well-being,<br>
just as the streams in the arid south are replenished.<br>
[5] Those who shed tears as they plant<br>
will shout for joy when they reap the harvest.<br>
[6] The one who weeps as he walks along, carrying his bag of seed,<br>
will certainly come in with a shout of joy, carrying his sheaves of grain.<br>
## Psalm 127

[1] If the **Lord** does not build a house,<br>
then those who build it work in vain.<br>
If the **Lord** does not guard a city,<br>
then the watchman stands guard in vain.<br>
[2] It is vain for you to rise early, come home late,<br>
and work so hard for your food.<br>
Yes, he provides for those whom he loves even when they sleep.<br>
[3] Yes, sons are a gift from the **Lord**;<br>
the fruit of the womb is a reward.<br>
[4] Sons born during one’s youth<br>
are like arrows in a warrior’s hand.<br>
[5] How blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them.<br>
They will not be put to shame when they confront enemies at the city gate.<br>
## Psalm 128

[1] How blessed is every one of the **Lord**’s loyal followers,<br>
each one who keeps his commands.<br>
[2] You will eat what you worked so hard to grow.<br>
You will be blessed and secure.<br>
[3] Your wife will be like a fruitful vine<br>
in the inner rooms of your house;<br>
your children will be like olive branches,<br>
as they sit all around your table.<br>
[4] Yes indeed, the man who fears the **Lord**<br>
will be blessed in this way.<br>
[5] May the **Lord** bless you from Zion,<br>
that you might see Jerusalem prosper<br>
all the days of your life,<br>
[6] and that you might see your grandchildren.<br>
May Israel experience peace.<br>
## Psalm 129

[1] “Since my youth they have often attacked me,”<br>
let Israel say.<br>
[2] “Since my youth they have often attacked me,<br>
but they have not defeated me.<br>
[3] The plowers plowed my back;<br>
they made their furrows long.<br>
[4] The **Lord** is just;<br>
he cut the ropes of the wicked.”<br>
[5] May all who hate Zion<br>
be humiliated and turned back.<br>
[6] May they be like the grass on the rooftops,<br>
which withers before one can even pull it up,<br>
[7] which cannot fill the reaper’s hand,<br>
or the lap of the one who gathers the grain.<br>
[8] Those who pass by will not say,<br>
“May you experience the **Lord**’s blessing!<br>
We pronounce a blessing on you in the name of the **Lord**.”<br>
## Psalm 130

[1] From the deep water I cry out to you, O **Lord**.<br>
[2] O Lord, listen to me.<br>
Pay attention to my plea for mercy.<br>
[3] If you, O **Lord**, were to keep track of sins,<br>
O Lord, who could stand before you?<br>
[4] But you are willing to forgive,<br>
so that you might be honored.<br>
[5] I rely on the **Lord**.<br>
I rely on him with my whole being;<br>
I wait for his assuring word.<br>
[6] I yearn for the Lord,<br>
more than watchmen do for the morning,<br>
yes, more than watchmen do for the morning.<br>
[7] O Israel, hope in the **Lord**,<br>
for the **Lord** exhibits loyal love,<br>
and is more than willing to deliver.<br>
[8] He will deliver Israel<br>
from all their sins.<br>
## Psalm 131

[1] O **Lord**, my heart is not proud,<br>
nor do I have a haughty look.<br>
I do not have great aspirations,<br>
or concern myself with things that are beyond me.<br>
[2] Indeed, I have calmed and quieted myself<br>
like a weaned child with its mother;<br>
I am content like a young child.<br>
[3] O Israel, hope in the **Lord**<br>
now and forevermore!<br>
## Psalm 132

[1] O **Lord**, for David’s sake remember<br>
all his strenuous effort,<br>
[2] and how he made a vow to the **Lord**,<br>
and swore an oath to the Powerful One of Jacob.<br>
[3] He said, “I will not enter my own home,<br>
or get into my bed.<br>
[4] I will not allow my eyes to sleep,<br>
or my eyelids to slumber,<br>
[5] until I find a place for the **Lord**,<br>
a fine dwelling place for the Powerful One of Jacob.”<br>
[6] Look, we heard about it in Ephrathah;<br>
we found it in the territory of Jaar.<br>
[7] Let us go to his dwelling place.<br>
Let us worship before his footstool.<br>
[8] Ascend, O **Lord**, to your resting place,<br>
you and the ark of your strength.<br>
[9] May your priests be clothed with integrity.<br>
May your loyal followers shout for joy.<br>
[10] For the sake of David, your servant,<br>
do not reject your chosen king.<br>
[11] The **Lord** made a reliable promise to David;<br>
he will not go back on his word.<br>
He said, “I will place one of your descendants on your throne.<br>
[12] If your sons keep my covenant<br>
and the rules I teach them,<br>
their sons will also sit on your throne forever.”<br>
[13] Certainly the **Lord** has chosen Zion;<br>
he decided to make it his home.<br>
[14] He said, “This will be my resting place forever;<br>
I will live here, for I have chosen it.<br>
[15] I will abundantly supply what she needs;<br>
I will give her poor all the food they need.<br>
[16] I will protect her priests,<br>
and her godly people will shout exuberantly.<br>
[17] There I will make David strong;<br>
I have determined that my chosen king’s dynasty will continue.<br>
[18] I will humiliate his enemies,<br>
and his crown will shine.”<br>
## Psalm 133

[1] Look! How good and how pleasant it is<br>
when brothers truly live in unity.<br>
[2] It is like fine oil poured on the head,<br>
which flows down the beard —<br>
Aaron’s beard,<br>
and then flows down his garments.<br>
[3] It is like the dew of Hermon,<br>
which flows down upon the hills of Zion.<br>
Indeed, that is where the **Lord** has decreed<br>
a blessing will be available—eternal life.<br>
## Psalm 134

[1] Attention! Praise the **Lord**,<br>
all you servants of the **Lord**,<br>
who serve in the **Lord**’s temple during the night.<br>
[2] Lift your hands toward the sanctuary<br>
and praise the **Lord**.<br>
[3] May the **Lord**, the Creator of heaven and earth,<br>
bless you from Zion.<br>
## Psalm 135

[1] Praise the **Lord**.<br>
Praise the name of the **Lord**.<br>
Offer praise, you servants of the **Lord**,<br>
[2] who serve in the **Lord**’s temple,<br>
in the courts of the temple of our God.<br>
[3] Praise the **Lord**, for the **Lord** is good.<br>
Sing praises to his name, for it is pleasant.<br>
[4] Indeed, the **Lord** has chosen Jacob for himself,<br>
Israel to be his special possession.<br>
[5] Yes, I know the **Lord** is great,<br>
and our Lord is superior to all gods.<br>
[6] He does whatever he pleases<br>
in heaven and on earth,<br>
in the seas and all the ocean depths.<br>
[7] He causes the clouds to arise from the end of the earth,<br>
makes lightning bolts accompany the rain,<br>
and brings the wind out of his storehouses.<br>
[8] He struck down the firstborn of Egypt,<br>
including both men and animals.<br>
[9] He performed awesome deeds and acts of judgment<br>
in your midst, O Egypt,<br>
against Pharaoh and all his servants.<br>
[10] He defeated many nations,<br>
and killed mighty kings—<br>
[11] Sihon, king of the Amorites,<br>
and Og, king of Bashan,<br>
and all the kingdoms of Canaan.<br>
[12] He gave their land as an inheritance,<br>
as an inheritance to Israel his people.<br>
[13] O **Lord**, your name endures,<br>
your reputation, O **Lord**, lasts.<br>
[14] For the **Lord** vindicates his people,<br>
and has compassion on his servants.<br>
[15] The nations’ idols are made of silver and gold;<br>
they are man-made.<br>
[16] They have mouths, but cannot speak,<br>
eyes, but cannot see,<br>
[17] and ears, but cannot hear.<br>
Indeed, they cannot breathe.<br>
[18] Those who make them will end up like them,<br>
as will everyone who trusts in them.<br>
[19] O family of Israel, praise the **Lord**.<br>
O family of Aaron, praise the **Lord**.<br>
[20] O family of Levi, praise the **Lord**.<br>
You loyal followers of the **Lord**, praise the **Lord**.<br>
[21] The **Lord** deserves praise in Zion —<br>
he who dwells in Jerusalem.<br>
Praise the **Lord**.<br>
## Psalm 136

[1] Give thanks to the **Lord**, for he is good,<br>
for his loyal love endures.<br>
[2] Give thanks to the God of gods,<br>
for his loyal love endures.<br>
[3] Give thanks to the Lord of lords,<br>
for his loyal love endures,<br>
[4] to the one who performs magnificent, amazing deeds all by himself,<br>
for his loyal love endures,<br>
[5] to the one who used wisdom to make the heavens,<br>
for his loyal love endures,<br>
[6] to the one who spread out the earth over the water,<br>
for his loyal love endures,<br>
[7] to the one who made the great lights,<br>
for his loyal love endures,<br>
[8] the sun to rule by day,<br>
for his loyal love endures,<br>
[9] the moon and stars to rule by night,<br>
for his loyal love endures,<br>
[10] to the one who struck down the firstborn of Egypt,<br>
for his loyal love endures,<br>
[11] and led Israel out from their midst,<br>
for his loyal love endures,<br>
[12] with a strong hand and an outstretched arm,<br>
for his loyal love endures,<br>
[13] to the one who divided the Red Sea in two,<br>
for his loyal love endures,<br>
[14] and led Israel through its midst,<br>
for his loyal love endures,<br>
[15] and tossed Pharaoh and his army into the Red Sea,<br>
for his loyal love endures,<br>
[16] to the one who led his people through the wilderness,<br>
for his loyal love endures,<br>
[17] to the one who struck down great kings,<br>
for his loyal love endures,<br>
[18] and killed powerful kings,<br>
for his loyal love endures,<br>
[19] Sihon, king of the Amorites,<br>
for his loyal love endures,<br>
[20] Og, king of Bashan,<br>
for his loyal love endures,<br>
[21] and gave their land as an inheritance,<br>
for his loyal love endures,<br>
[22] as an inheritance to Israel his servant,<br>
for his loyal love endures,<br>
[23] to the one who remembered us when we were down,<br>
for his loyal love endures,<br>
[24] and snatched us away from our enemies,<br>
for his loyal love endures,<br>
[25] to the one who gives food to all living things,<br>
for his loyal love endures.<br>
[26] Give thanks to the God of heaven,<br>
for his loyal love endures!<br>
## Psalm 137

[1] By the rivers of Babylon<br>
we sit down and weep<br>
when we remember Zion.<br>
[2] On the poplars in her midst<br>
we hang our harps,<br>
[3] for there our captors ask us to compose songs;<br>
those who mock us demand that we be happy, saying:<br>
“Sing for us a song about Zion!”<br>
[4] How can we sing a song to the **Lord**<br>
in a foreign land?<br>
[5] If I forget you, O Jerusalem,<br>
may my right hand be crippled.<br>
[6] May my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth,<br>
if I do not remember you,<br>
and do not give Jerusalem priority<br>
over whatever gives me the most joy.<br>
[7] Remember, O **Lord**, what the Edomites did<br>
on the day Jerusalem fell.<br>
They said, “Tear it down, tear it down,<br>
right to its very foundation!”<br>
[8] O daughter Babylon, soon to be devastated,<br>
how blessed will be the one who repays you<br>
for what you dished out to us.<br>
[9] How blessed will be the one who grabs your babies<br>
and smashes them on a rock.<br>
## Psalm 138

[1] I will give you thanks with all my heart;<br>
before the heavenly assembly I will sing praises to you.<br>
[2] I will bow down toward your holy temple,<br>
and give thanks to your name,<br>
because of your loyal love and faithfulness,<br>
for you have exalted your promise above the entire sky.<br>
[3] When I cried out for help, you answered me.<br>
You made me bold and energized me.<br>
[4] Let all the kings of the earth give thanks to you, O **Lord**,<br>
when they hear the words you speak.<br>
[5] Let them sing about the **Lord**’s deeds,<br>
for the **Lord**’s splendor is magnificent.<br>
[6] Though the **Lord** is exalted, he looks after the lowly,<br>
and from far away humbles the proud.<br>
[7] Even when I must walk in the midst of danger, you revive me.<br>
You oppose my angry enemies,<br>
and your right hand delivers me.<br>
[8] The **Lord** avenges me.<br>
O **Lord**, your loyal love endures.<br>
Do not abandon those whom you have made.<br>
## Psalm 139

[1] O **Lord**, you examine me and know me.<br>
[2] You know when I sit down and when I get up;<br>
even from far away you understand my motives.<br>
[3] You carefully observe me when I travel or when I lie down to rest;<br>
you are aware of everything I do.<br>
[4] Certainly my tongue does not frame a word<br>
without you, O **Lord**, being thoroughly aware of it.<br>
[5] You squeeze me in from behind and in front;<br>
you place your hand on me.<br>
[6] Your knowledge is beyond my comprehension;<br>
it is so far beyond me, I am unable to fathom it.<br>
[7] Where can I go to escape your Spirit?<br>
Where can I flee to escape your presence?<br>
[8] If I were to ascend to heaven, you would be there.<br>
If I were to sprawl out in Sheol, there you would be.<br>
[9] If I were to fly away on the wings of the dawn,<br>
and settle down on the other side of the sea,<br>
[10] even there your hand would guide me,<br>
your right hand would grab hold of me.<br>
[11] If I were to say, “Certainly the darkness will cover me,<br>
and the light will turn to night all around me,”<br>
[12] even the darkness is not too dark for you to see,<br>
and the night is as bright as day;<br>
darkness and light are the same to you.<br>
[13] Certainly you made my mind and heart;<br>
you wove me together in my mother’s womb.<br>
[14] I will give you thanks because your deeds are awesome and amazing.<br>
You knew me thoroughly;<br>
[15] my bones were not hidden from you,<br>
when I was made in secret<br>
and sewed together in the depths of the earth.<br>
[16] Your eyes saw me when I was inside the womb.<br>
All the days ordained for me<br>
were recorded in your scroll<br>
before one of them came into existence.<br>
[17] How difficult it is for me to fathom your thoughts about me, O God!<br>
How vast is their sum total.<br>
[18] If I tried to count them,<br>
they would outnumber the grains of sand.<br>
Even if I finished counting them,<br>
I would still have to contend with you.<br>
[19] If only you would kill the wicked, O God!<br>
Get away from me, you violent men!<br>
[20] They rebel against you and act deceitfully;<br>
your enemies lie.<br>
[21] O **Lord**, do I not hate those who hate you,<br>
and despise those who oppose you?<br>
[22] I absolutely hate them;<br>
they have become my enemies.<br>
[23] Examine me, O God, and probe my thoughts.<br>
Test me, and know my concerns.<br>
[24] See if there is any idolatrous way in me,<br>
and lead me in the everlasting way.<br>
## Psalm 140

[1] O **Lord**, rescue me from wicked men.<br>
Protect me from violent men,<br>
[2] who plan ways to harm me.<br>
All day long they stir up conflict.<br>
[3] Their tongues wound like a serpent;<br>
a viper’s venom is behind their lips. (Selah)<br>
[4] O **Lord**, shelter me from the power of the wicked.<br>
Protect me from violent men,<br>
who plan to knock me over.<br>
[5] Proud men hide a snare for me;<br>
evil men spread a net by the path.<br>
They set traps for me. (Selah)<br>
[6] I say to the **Lord**, “You are my God.”<br>
O **Lord**, pay attention to my plea for mercy.<br>
[7] O Sovereign **Lord**, my strong deliverer,<br>
you shield my head in the day of battle.<br>
[8] O **Lord**, do not let the wicked have their way.<br>
Do not allow their plan to succeed when they attack. (Selah)<br>
[9] As for the heads of those who surround me—<br>
may the harm done by their lips overwhelm them.<br>
[10] May he rain down fiery coals upon them.<br>
May he throw them into the fire.<br>
From bottomless pits they will not escape.<br>
[11] A slanderer will not endure on the earth;<br>
calamity will hunt down a violent man and strike him down.<br>
[12] I know that the **Lord** defends the cause of the oppressed<br>
and vindicates the poor.<br>
[13] Certainly the godly will give thanks to your name;<br>
the morally upright will live in your presence.<br>
## Psalm 141

[1] O **Lord**, I cry out to you. Come quickly to me.<br>
Pay attention to me when I cry out to you.<br>
[2] May you accept my prayer like incense,<br>
my uplifted hands like the evening offering.<br>
[3] O **Lord**, place a guard on my mouth.<br>
Protect the opening of my lips.<br>
[4] Do not let me have evil desires,<br>
or participate in sinful activities<br>
with men who behave wickedly.<br>
I will not eat their delicacies.<br>
[5] May the godly strike me in love and correct me.<br>
May my head not refuse choice oil.<br>
Indeed, my prayer is a witness against their evil deeds.<br>
[6] They will be thrown over the side of a cliff by their judges.<br>
They will listen to my words, for they are pleasant.<br>
[7] As when one plows and breaks up the soil,<br>
so our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.<br>
[8] Surely I am looking to you, O Sovereign **Lord**.<br>
In you I take shelter.<br>
Do not expose me to danger.<br>
[9] Protect me from the snare they have laid for me,<br>
and the traps the evildoers have set.<br>
[10] Let the wicked fall into their own nets,<br>
while I escape.<br>
## Psalm 142

[1] To the **Lord** I cry out;<br>
to the **Lord** I plead for mercy.<br>
[2] I pour out my lament before him;<br>
I tell him about my troubles.<br>
[3] Even when my strength leaves me,<br>
you watch my footsteps.<br>
In the path where I walk<br>
they have hidden a trap for me.<br>
[4] Look to the right and see.<br>
No one cares about me.<br>
I have nowhere to run;<br>
no one is concerned about my life.<br>
[5] I cry out to you, O **Lord**;<br>
I say, “You are my shelter,<br>
my security in the land of the living.”<br>
[6] Listen to my cry for help,<br>
for I am in serious trouble.<br>
Rescue me from those who chase me,<br>
for they are stronger than I am.<br>
[7] Free me from prison,<br>
that I may give thanks to your name.<br>
Because of me the godly will assemble,<br>
for you will vindicate me.<br>
## Psalm 143

[1] O **Lord**, hear my prayer.<br>
Pay attention to my plea for help.<br>
Because of your faithfulness and justice, answer me.<br>
[2] Do not sit in judgment on your servant,<br>
for no one alive is innocent before you.<br>
[3] Certainly my enemies chase me.<br>
They smash me into the ground.<br>
They force me to live in dark regions,<br>
like those who have been dead for ages.<br>
[4] My strength leaves me;<br>
I am absolutely shocked.<br>
[5] I recall the old days.<br>
I meditate on all you have done;<br>
I reflect on your accomplishments.<br>
[6] I spread my hands out to you in prayer;<br>
my soul thirsts for you in a parched land. (Selah)<br>
[7] Answer me quickly, **Lord**.<br>
My strength is fading.<br>
Do not reject me,<br>
or I will join those descending into the grave.<br>
[8] May I hear about your loyal love in the morning,<br>
for I trust in you.<br>
Show me the way I should go,<br>
because I long for you.<br>
[9] Rescue me from my enemies, O **Lord**.<br>
I run to you for protection.<br>
[10] Teach me to do what pleases you,<br>
for you are my God.<br>
May your kind presence<br>
lead me into a level land.<br>
[11] O **Lord**, for the sake of your reputation, revive me.<br>
Because of your justice, rescue me from trouble.<br>
[12] As a demonstration of your loyal love, destroy my enemies.<br>
Annihilate all who threaten my life,<br>
for I am your servant.<br>
## Psalm 144

[1] The **Lord**, my Protector, deserves praise —<br>
the one who trains my hands for battle,<br>
and my fingers for war,<br>
[2] who loves me and is my stronghold,<br>
my refuge and my deliverer,<br>
my shield and the one in whom I take shelter,<br>
who makes nations submit to me.<br>
[3] O **Lord**, of what importance is the human race, that you should notice them?<br>
Of what importance is mankind, that you should be concerned about them?<br>
[4] People are like a vapor,<br>
their days like a shadow that disappears.<br>
[5] O **Lord**, make the sky sink and come down.<br>
Touch the mountains and make them smolder.<br>
[6] Hurl lightning bolts and scatter the enemy.<br>
Shoot your arrows and rout them.<br>
[7] Reach down from above.<br>
Grab me and rescue me from the surging water,<br>
from the power of foreigners,<br>
[8] who speak lies,<br>
and make false promises.<br>
[9] O God, I will sing a new song to you.<br>
Accompanied by a ten-stringed instrument, I will sing praises to you,<br>
[10] the one who delivers kings,<br>
and rescued David his servant from a deadly sword.<br>
[11] Grab me and rescue me from the power of foreigners,<br>
who speak lies,<br>
and make false promises.<br>
[12] Then our sons will be like plants,<br>
that quickly grow to full size.<br>
Our daughters will be like corner pillars,<br>
carved like those in a palace.<br>
[13] Our storehouses will be full,<br>
providing all kinds of food.<br>
Our sheep will multiply by the thousands<br>
and fill our pastures.<br>
[14] Our cattle will be weighted down with produce.<br>
No one will break through our walls,<br>
no one will be taken captive,<br>
and there will be no terrified cries in our city squares.<br>
[15] How blessed are the people who experience these things.<br>
How blessed are the people whose God is the **Lord**.<br>
## Psalm 145

[1] I will extol you, my God, O King.<br>
I will praise your name continually.<br>
[2] Every day I will praise you.<br>
I will praise your name continually.<br>
[3] The **Lord** is great and certainly worthy of praise.<br>
No one can fathom his greatness.<br>
[4] One generation will praise your deeds to another,<br>
and tell about your mighty acts.<br>
[5] I will focus on your honor and majestic splendor,<br>
and your amazing deeds.<br>
[6] They will proclaim the power of your awesome acts.<br>
I will declare your great deeds.<br>
[7] They will talk about the fame of your great kindness,<br>
and sing about your justice.<br>
[8] The **Lord** is merciful and compassionate;<br>
he is patient and demonstrates great loyal love.<br>
[9] The **Lord** is good to all,<br>
and has compassion on all he has made.<br>
[10] All your works will give thanks to you, **Lord**.<br>
Your loyal followers will praise you.<br>
[11] They will proclaim the splendor of your kingdom;<br>
they will tell about your power,<br>
[12] so that mankind might acknowledge your mighty acts,<br>
and the majestic splendor of your kingdom.<br>
[13] Your kingdom is an eternal kingdom,<br>
and your dominion endures through all generations.<br>
[14] The **Lord** supports all who fall,<br>
and lifts up all who are bent over.<br>
[15] Everything looks to you in anticipation,<br>
and you provide them with food on a regular basis.<br>
[16] You open your hand,<br>
and fill every living thing with the food it desires.<br>
[17] The **Lord** is just in all his actions,<br>
and exhibits love in all he does.<br>
[18] The **Lord** is near all who cry out to him,<br>
all who cry out to him sincerely.<br>
[19] He satisfies the desire of his loyal followers;<br>
he hears their cry for help and delivers them.<br>
[20] The **Lord** protects all those who love him,<br>
but he destroys all the wicked.<br>
[21] My mouth will praise the **Lord**.<br>
Let all who live praise his holy name forever.<br>
## Psalm 146

[1] Praise the **Lord**.<br>
Praise the **Lord**, O my soul.<br>
[2] I will praise the **Lord** as long as I live.<br>
I will sing praises to my God as long as I exist.<br>
[3] Do not trust in princes,<br>
or in human beings, who cannot deliver.<br>
[4] Their life’s breath departs, they return to the ground.<br>
On that day their plans die.<br>
[5] How blessed is the one whose helper is the God of Jacob,<br>
whose hope is in the **Lord** his God,<br>
[6] the one who made heaven and earth,<br>
the sea, and all that is in them,<br>
who remains forever faithful,<br>
[7] vindicates the oppressed,<br>
and gives food to the hungry.<br>
The **Lord** releases the imprisoned.<br>
[8] The **Lord** gives sight to the blind.<br>
The **Lord** lifts up all who are bent over.<br>
The **Lord** loves the godly.<br>
[9] The **Lord** protects the resident foreigner.<br>
He lifts up the fatherless and the widow,<br>
but he opposes the wicked.<br>
[10] The **Lord** rules forever,<br>
your God, O Zion, throughout the generations to come.<br>
Praise the **Lord**!<br>
## Psalm 147

[1] Praise the **Lord**,<br>
for it is good to sing praises to our God.<br>
Yes, praise is pleasant and appropriate.<br>
[2] The **Lord** rebuilds Jerusalem,<br>
and gathers the exiles of Israel.<br>
[3] He heals the brokenhearted,<br>
and bandages their wounds.<br>
[4] He counts the number of the stars;<br>
he names all of them.<br>
[5] Our Lord is great and has awesome power;<br>
there is no limit to his wisdom.<br>
[6] The **Lord** lifts up the oppressed,<br>
but knocks the wicked to the ground.<br>
[7] Offer to the **Lord** a song of thanks.<br>
Sing praises to our God to the accompaniment of a harp.<br>
[8] He covers the sky with clouds,<br>
provides the earth with rain,<br>
and causes grass to grow on the hillsides.<br>
[9] He gives food to the animals,<br>
and to the young ravens when they chirp.<br>
[10] He is not enamored with the strength of a horse,<br>
nor is he impressed by the warrior’s strong legs.<br>
[11] The **Lord** takes delight in his faithful followers,<br>
and in those who wait for his loyal love.<br>
[12] Extol the **Lord**, O Jerusalem.<br>
Praise your God, O Zion.<br>
[13] For he makes the bars of your gates strong.<br>
He blesses your children within you.<br>
[14] He brings peace to your territory.<br>
He abundantly provides for you the best grain.<br>
[15] He sends his command through the earth;<br>
swiftly his order reaches its destination.<br>
[16] He sends the snow that is white like wool;<br>
he spreads the frost that is white like ashes.<br>
[17] He throws his hailstones like crumbs.<br>
Who can withstand the cold wind he sends?<br>
[18] He then orders it all to melt;<br>
he breathes on it, and the water flows.<br>
[19] He proclaims his word to Jacob,<br>
his statutes and regulations to Israel.<br>
[20] He has not done so with any other nation;<br>
they are not aware of his regulations.<br>
Praise the **Lord**!<br>
## Psalm 148

[1] Praise the **Lord**.<br>
Praise the **Lord** from the sky.<br>
Praise him in the heavens.<br>
[2] Praise him, all his angels.<br>
Praise him, all his heavenly assembly.<br>
[3] Praise him, O sun and moon.<br>
Praise him, all you shiny stars.<br>
[4] Praise him, O highest heaven,<br>
and you waters above the sky.<br>
[5] Let them praise the name of the **Lord**,<br>
for he gave the command and they came into existence.<br>
[6] He established them so they would endure;<br>
he issued a decree that will not be revoked.<br>
[7] Praise the **Lord** from the earth,<br>
you sea creatures and all you ocean depths,<br>
[8] O fire and hail, snow and clouds,<br>
O stormy wind that carries out his orders,<br>
[9] you mountains and all you hills,<br>
you fruit trees and all you cedars,<br>
[10] you animals and all you cattle,<br>
you creeping things and birds,<br>
[11] you kings of the earth and all you nations,<br>
you princes and all you leaders on the earth,<br>
[12] you young men and young women,<br>
you elderly, along with you children.<br>
[13] Let them praise the name of the **Lord**,<br>
for his name alone is exalted;<br>
his majesty extends over the earth and sky.<br>
[14] He has made his people victorious,<br>
and given all his loyal followers reason to praise—<br>
the Israelites, the people who are close to him.<br>
Praise the **Lord**!<br>

Let the people of Zion delight in their King.<br>
[3] Let them praise his name with dancing.<br>
Let them sing praises to him to the accompaniment of the tambourine and harp.<br>
[4] For the **Lord** takes delight in his people;<br>
he exalts the oppressed by delivering them.<br>
[5] Let the godly rejoice because of their vindication.<br>
Let them shout for joy upon their beds.<br>
[6] May the praises of God be in their mouths<br>
and a two-edged sword in their hands,<br>
[7] in order to take revenge on the nations,<br>
and punish foreigners.<br>
[8] The godly bind their enemies’ kings in chains,<br>
and their nobles in iron shackles,<br>
[9] and execute the judgment to which their enemies have been sentenced.<br>
All his loyal followers will be vindicated.<br>
Praise the **Lord**.<br>
