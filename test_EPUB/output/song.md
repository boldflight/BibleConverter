“Arise, my darling;<br>
My beautiful one, come away with me!<br>

## Chapter 3

### The Lost Lover is Found

I longed for my lover.<br>
I longed for him but he never appeared.<br>
[2] “I will arise and look all around throughout the town,<br>
and throughout the streets and squares;<br>
I will search for my beloved.”<br>
I searched for him but I did not find him.<br>
[3] The night watchmen found me—the ones who guard the city walls.<br>
“Have you seen my beloved?”<br>
[4] Scarcely had I passed them by<br>
when I found my beloved!<br>
I held onto him tightly and would not let him go<br>
until I brought him to my mother’s house,<br>
to the bedroom chamber of the one who conceived me.<br>

#### The Speaker:

[6] Who is this coming up from the wilderness<br>
like a column of smoke,<br>
like a fragrant billow of myrrh and frankincense,<br>
every kind of fragrant powder of the traveling merchants?<br>
[7] Look! It is Solomon’s portable couch!<br>
It is surrounded by sixty warriors,<br>
some of Israel’s mightiest warriors.<br>
[8] All of them are skilled with a sword,<br>
well trained in the art of warfare.<br>
Each has his sword at his side,<br>
to guard against the terrors of the night.<br>
[9] King Solomon made a sedan chair for himself<br>
of wood imported from Lebanon.<br>
[10] Its posts were made of silver;<br>
its back was made of gold.<br>
Its seat was upholstered with purple wool;<br>
its interior was inlaid with leather by the maidens of Jerusalem.<br>
[11] Come out, O maidens of Zion,<br>
and gaze upon King Solomon!<br>
He is wearing the crown with which his mother crowned him<br>
on his wedding day,<br>
on the most joyous day of his life!<br>

Your hair is like a flock of female goats<br>
descending from Mount Gilead.<br>

one thousand shields are hung on it—<br>
all shields of valiant warriors.<br>
[5] Your two breasts are like two fawns,<br>
twins of the gazelle<br>
grazing among the lilies.<br>
[6] Until the dawn arrives<br>
and the shadows flee,<br>
I will go up to the mountain of myrrh,<br>
and to the hill of frankincense.<br>
[7] You are altogether beautiful, my darling!<br>
There is no blemish in you!<br>
### The Wedding Night: Beautiful as Lebanon

[8] Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,<br>
come with me from Lebanon.<br>
Descend from the crest of Amana,<br>
from the top of Senir, the summit of Hermon,<br>
from the lions’ dens<br>
and the mountain haunts of the leopards.<br>
[9] You have stolen my heart, my sister, my bride!<br>
You have stolen my heart with one glance of your eyes,<br>
with one jewel of your necklace.<br>
[10] How delightful is your love, my sister, my bride!<br>
How much better is your love than wine;<br>
the fragrance of your perfume is better than any spice!<br>

honey and milk are under your tongue.<br>
The fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon.<br>
### The Wedding Night: The Delightful Garden

you are an enclosed spring, a sealed-up fountain.<br>
[13] Your shoots are a royal garden full of pomegranates<br>
with choice fruits:<br>
henna with nard,<br>
[14] nard and saffron,<br>
calamus and cinnamon with every kind of spice,<br>
myrrh and aloes with all the finest spices.<br>
[15] You are a garden spring,<br>
a well of fresh water flowing down from Lebanon.<br>
#### The Beloved to Her Lover:

[16] Awake, O north wind; come, O south wind!<br>
Blow on my garden so that its fragrant spices may send out their sweet smell.<br>
May my beloved come into his garden<br>
and eat its delightful fruit!<br>

Eat, friends, and drink!<br>
Drink freely, O lovers!<br>

Listen! My lover is knocking at the door!<br>

my dove, my flawless one!<br>
My head is drenched with dew,<br>
my hair with the dampness of the night.”<br>

[3] “I have already taken off my robe—must I put it on again?<br>
I have already washed my feet—must I soil them again?”<br>
[4] My lover thrust his hand through the hole,<br>
and my feelings were stirred for him.<br>
[5] I arose to open for my beloved;<br>
my hands dripped with myrrh—<br>
my fingers flowed with myrrh<br>
on the handles of the lock.<br>
[6] I opened for my beloved,<br>
but my lover had already turned and gone away.<br>
I fell into despair when he departed.<br>
I looked for him but did not find him;<br>
I called him but he did not answer me.<br>
[7] The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city.<br>
They beat me, they bruised me;<br>
they took away my cloak, those watchmen on the walls!<br>
### The Triumph of Love: The Beloved Praises Her Lover

If you find my beloved, what will you tell him?<br>
Tell him that I am lovesick!<br>

[9] Why is your beloved better than others,<br>
O most beautiful of women?<br>
Why is your beloved better than others,<br>
that you would admonish us in this manner?<br>
#### The Beloved to the Maidens:

[10] My beloved is dazzling and ruddy;<br>
he stands out in comparison to all other men.<br>
[11] His head is like the purest gold.<br>
His hair is curly —black like a raven.<br>

washed in milk, mounted like jewels.<br>

descending from Mount Gilead.<br>
[6] Your teeth are like a flock of sheep<br>
coming up from the washing;<br>
each has its twin;<br>
not one of them is missing.<br>
[7] Like a slice of pomegranate<br>
is your forehead behind your veil.<br>
[8] There may be sixty queens,<br>
and eighty concubines,<br>
and young women without number.<br>
[9] But she is unique,<br>
my dove, my perfect one!<br>
She is the special daughter of her mother;<br>
she is the favorite of the one who bore her.<br>
The maidens saw her and complimented her;<br>
the queens and concubines praised her:<br>
[10] “Who is this who appears like the dawn?<br>
Beautiful as the moon, bright as the sun,<br>
awe-inspiring as the stars in procession?”<br>
### The Return to the Vineyards

[11] I went down to the orchard of walnut trees,<br>
to look for the blossoms of the valley,<br>

O nobleman’s daughter!<br>

the work of the hands of a master craftsman.<br>
[2] Your navel is a round mixing bowl —<br>
may it never lack mixed wine!<br>
Your belly is a mound of wheat,<br>
encircled by lilies.<br>
[3] Your two breasts are like two fawns,<br>
twins of a gazelle.<br>
[4] Your neck is like a tower made of ivory.<br>
Your eyes are the pools in Heshbon<br>
by the gate of Bath Rabbim.<br>
Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon<br>
overlooking Damascus.<br>

The locks of your hair are like royal tapestries —<br>
the king is held captive in its tresses!<br>
[6] How beautiful you are! How lovely,<br>
O love, with your delights!<br>
### The Palm Tree and the Palm Tree Climber

[7] Your stature is like a palm tree,<br>
and your breasts are like clusters of grapes.<br>
[8] I want to climb the palm tree,<br>
and take hold of its fruit stalks.<br>
May your breasts be like the clusters of grapes,<br>
and may the fragrance of your breath be like apples!<br>

let us spend the night in the villages.<br>
[12] Let us rise early to go to the vineyards,<br>
to see if the vines have budded,<br>
to see if their blossoms have opened,<br>
if the pomegranates are in bloom—<br>
there I will give you my love.<br>
[13] The mandrakes send out their fragrance;<br>
over our door is every delicacy,<br>
both new and old, which I have stored up for you, my lover.<br>
## Chapter 8

### The Beloved’s Wish Song

[1] Oh, how I wish you were my little brother,<br>
nursing at my mother’s breasts;<br>
if I saw you outside, I could kiss you—<br>
surely no one would despise me!<br>
[2] I would lead you and bring you to my mother’s house,<br>
the one who taught me.<br>
I would give you spiced wine to drink,<br>
the nectar of my pomegranates.<br>

leaning on her beloved?<br>
#### The Beloved to Her Lover:

Under the apple tree I aroused you;<br>
there your mother conceived you,<br>
there she who bore you was in labor of childbirth.<br>
### The Nature of True Love

#### The Beloved to Her Lover:

[6] Set me like a cylinder seal over your heart,<br>
like a signet on your arm.<br>
For love is as strong as death,<br>
passion is as unrelenting as Sheol.<br>
Its flames burst forth,<br>
it is a blazing flame.<br>
[7] Surging waters cannot quench love;<br>
floodwaters cannot overflow it.<br>
If someone were to offer all his possessions to buy love,<br>
the offer would be utterly despised.<br>
### The Brother’s Plan and the Sister’s Reward

#### The Beloved’s Brothers:

[8] We have a little sister,<br>
and as yet she has no breasts.<br>
What shall we do for our sister<br>
on the day when she is spoken for?<br>
[9] If she is a wall,<br>
we will build on her a battlement of silver;<br>
but if she is a door,<br>
we will barricade her with boards of cedar.<br>
#### The Beloved:

[10] I was a wall,<br>
and my breasts were like fortress towers.<br>
Then I found favor in his eyes.<br>
### Solomon’s Vineyard and the Beloved’s Vineyard

#### The Beloved to Her Lover:

[11] Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon;<br>
he leased out the vineyard to those who maintained it.<br>
Each was to bring 1,000 shekels of silver for its fruit.<br>
[12] My vineyard, which belongs to me, is at my disposal alone.<br>
The thousand shekels belong to you, O Solomon,<br>
and 200 shekels belong to those who maintain it for its fruit.<br>
### Epilogue: The Lover’s Request and His Beloved’s Invitation

#### The Lover to His Beloved:

[13] O you who stay in the gardens,<br>
my companions are listening attentively for your voice;<br>
let me be the one to hear it!<br>
#### The Beloved to Her Lover:

[14] Make haste, my beloved!<br>
Be like a gazelle or a young stag<br>
on the mountains of spices.<br>
