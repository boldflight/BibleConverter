# Zephaniah

## Chapter 1

### Introduction

[1] This is the **Lord**'s message that came to Zephaniah son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah during the time of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah:

### The Lord’s Day of Judgment is Approaching

[2] “I will destroy everything from the face of the earth,” says the **Lord**.<br>
[3] “I will destroy people and animals;<br>
I will destroy the birds in the sky<br>
and the fish in the sea.<br>
(The idolatrous images of these creatures will be destroyed along with evil people.)<br>
I will remove humanity from the face of the earth,” says the **Lord**.<br>
[4] “I will attack Judah<br>
and all who live in Jerusalem.<br>
I will remove from this place every trace of Baal worship,<br>
as well as the very memory of the pagan priests.<br>
[5] I will remove those who worship the stars in the sky from their rooftops,<br>
those who swear allegiance to the **Lord** while taking oaths in the name of their ‘king,’<br>
[6] and those who turn their backs on the **Lord**<br>
and do not want the **Lord**’s help or guidance.”<br>
[7] Be silent before the Sovereign **Lord**,<br>
for the **Lord**'s day of judgment is almost here.<br>
The **Lord** has prepared a sacrificial meal;<br>
he has ritually purified his guests.<br>
[8] “On the day of the **Lord**’s sacrificial meal,<br>
I will punish the princes and the king’s sons,<br>
and all who wear foreign styles of clothing.<br>
[9] On that day I will punish all who leap over the threshold,<br>
who fill the house of their master with wealth taken by violence and deceit.<br>
[10] On that day,” says the **Lord**,<br>
“a loud cry will go up from the Fish Gate,<br>
wailing from the city’s newer district,<br>
and a loud crash from the hills.<br>
[11] Wail, you who live in the market district,<br>
for all the merchants will disappear<br>
and those who count money will be removed.<br>
[12] At that time I will search through Jerusalem with lamps.<br>
I will punish the people who are entrenched in their sin,<br>
those who think to themselves,<br>
‘The **Lord** neither rewards nor punishes.’<br>
[13] Their wealth will be stolen<br>
and their houses ruined!<br>
They will not live in the houses they have built,<br>
nor will they drink the wine from the vineyards they have planted.<br>
[14] The **Lord**’s great day of judgment is almost here;<br>
it is approaching very rapidly!<br>
There will be a bitter sound on the **Lord**’s day of judgment;<br>
at that time warriors will cry out in battle.<br>
[15] That day will be a day of God’s anger,<br>
a day of distress and hardship,<br>
a day of devastation and ruin,<br>
a day of darkness and gloom,<br>
a day of clouds and dark skies,<br>
[16] a day of trumpet blasts and battle cries.<br>
Judgment will fall on the fortified cities and the high corner towers.<br>
[17] I will bring distress on the people<br>
and they will stumble like blind men,<br>
for they have sinned against the **Lord**.<br>
Their blood will be poured out like dirt;<br>
their flesh will be scattered like manure.<br>
[18] Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to deliver them<br>
in the day of the **Lord**’s angry judgment.<br>
The whole earth will be consumed by his fiery wrath.<br>
Indeed, he will bring terrifying destruction on all who live on the earth.”<br>
## Chapter 2

### The Prophet Warns the People

[1] Bunch yourselves together like straw, you undesirable nation,<br>
[2] before God’s decree becomes reality and the day of opportunity disappears like windblown chaff,<br>
before the **Lord**’s raging anger overtakes you—<br>
before the day of the **Lord**’s angry judgment overtakes you!<br>
[3] Seek the **Lord**’s favor, all you humble people of the land who have obeyed his commands!<br>
Strive to do what is right! Strive to be humble!<br>
Maybe you will be protected on the day of the **Lord**’s angry judgment.<br>
### Judgment on Surrounding Nations

[4] Indeed, Gaza will be deserted<br>
and Ashkelon will become a heap of ruins.<br>
Invaders will drive away the people of Ashdod by noon,<br>
and Ekron will be overthrown.<br>
[5] Beware, you who live by the sea, the people who came from Crete.<br>
The **Lord**'s message is against you, Canaan, land of the Philistines:<br>
“I will destroy everyone who lives there!”<br>
[6] The seacoast will be used as pasture lands by the shepherds<br>
and as pens for their flocks.<br>
[7] Those who are left from the kingdom of Judah will take possession of it.<br>
By the sea they will graze,<br>
in the houses of Ashkelon they will lie down in the evening,<br>
for the **Lord** their God will intervene for them and restore their prosperity.<br>
[8] “I have heard Moab’s taunts<br>
and the Ammonites’ insults.<br>
They taunted my people<br>
and verbally harassed those living in Judah.<br>
[9] Therefore, as surely as I live,” says the **Lord** of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel,<br>
“be certain that Moab will become like Sodom<br>
and the Ammonites like Gomorrah.<br>
They will be overrun by weeds,<br>
filled with salt pits,<br>
and permanently desolate.<br>
Those of my people who are left will plunder their belongings;<br>
those who are left in Judah will take possession of their land.”<br>
[10] This is how they will be repaid for their arrogance,<br>
for they taunted and verbally harassed the people of the **Lord** of Heaven’s Armies.<br>
[11] The **Lord** will terrify them,<br>
for he will weaken all the gods of the earth.<br>
All the distant nations will worship the **Lord** in their own lands.<br>
[12] “You Ethiopians will also die by my sword!”<br>
[13] The **Lord** will attack the north<br>
and destroy Assyria.<br>
He will make Nineveh a heap of ruins;<br>
it will be as barren as the desert.<br>
[14] Flocks and herds will lie down in the middle of it,<br>
as well as every kind of wild animal.<br>
Owls will sleep in the tops of its support pillars;<br>
they will hoot through the windows.<br>
Rubble will cover the thresholds;<br>
even the cedar work will be exposed to the elements.<br>
[15] This is how the once-proud city will end up—<br>
the city that was so secure.<br>
She thought to herself, “I am unique! No one can compare to me!”<br>
What a heap of ruins she has become, a place where wild animals live!<br>
Everyone who passes by her taunts her and shakes his fist.<br>
## Chapter 3

### Jerusalem is Corrupt

[1] Beware to the filthy, stained city;<br>
the city filled with oppressors!<br>
[2] She is disobedient;<br>
she has refused correction.<br>
She does not trust the **Lord**;<br>
she has not sought the advice of her God.<br>
[3] Her princes are as fierce as roaring lions;<br>
her rulers are as hungry as wolves in the desert,<br>
who completely devour their prey by morning.<br>
[4] Her prophets are proud;<br>
they are deceitful men.<br>
Her priests have defiled what is holy;<br>
they have broken God’s laws.<br>
[5] The just **Lord** resides within her;<br>
he commits no unjust acts.<br>
Every morning he reveals his justice.<br>
At dawn he appears without fail.<br>
Yet the unjust know no shame.<br>
### The Lord’s Judgment will Purify

[6] “I destroyed nations;<br>
their walled cities are in ruins.<br>
I turned their streets into ruins;<br>
no one passes through them.<br>
Their cities are desolate;<br>
no one lives there.<br>
[7] I thought, ‘Certainly you will respect me!<br>
Now you will accept correction!’<br>
If she had done so, her home would not be destroyed<br>
by all the punishments I have threatened.<br>
But they eagerly sinned<br>
in everything they did.<br>
[8] Therefore you must wait patiently for me,” says the **Lord**,<br>
“for the day when I attack and take plunder.<br>
I have decided to gather nations together<br>
and assemble kingdoms,<br>
so I can pour out my fury on them—<br>
all my raging anger.<br>
For the whole earth will be consumed<br>
by my fiery anger.<br>
[9] Know for sure that I will then enable<br>
the nations to give me acceptable praise.<br>
All of them will invoke the **Lord**’s name when they pray,<br>
and will worship him in unison.<br>
[10] From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia,<br>
those who pray to me, my dispersed people,<br>
will bring me tribute.<br>
[11] In that day you will not be ashamed of all your rebelliousness against me,<br>
for then I will remove from your midst those who proudly boast,<br>
and you will never again be arrogant on my holy hill.<br>
[12] I will leave in your midst a humble and meek group of people,<br>
and they will find safety in the **Lord**’s presence.<br>
[13] The Israelites who remain will not act deceitfully.<br>
They will not lie,<br>
and a deceitful tongue will not be found in their mouths.<br>
Indeed, they will graze peacefully like sheep and lie down;<br>
no one will terrify them.”<br>
[14] Shout for joy, Daughter Zion!<br>
Shout out, Israel!<br>
Be happy and boast with all your heart, Daughter Jerusalem!<br>
[15] The **Lord** has removed the judgment against you;<br>
he has turned back your enemy.<br>
Israel’s king, the **Lord**, is in your midst!<br>
You no longer need to fear disaster.<br>
[16] On that day they will say to Jerusalem,<br>
“Don’t be afraid, Zion!<br>
Your hands must not be paralyzed from panic!<br>
[17] The **Lord** your God is in your midst;<br>
he is a warrior who can deliver.<br>
He takes great delight in you;<br>
he renews you by his love;<br>
he shouts for joy over you.”<br>
[18] “As for those who grieve because they cannot attend the festivals—<br>
I took them away from you;<br>
they became tribute and were a source of shame to you.<br>
[19] Look, at that time I will deal with those who mistreated you.<br>
I will rescue the lame sheep<br>
and gather together the scattered sheep.<br>
I will take away their humiliation<br>
and make the whole earth admire and respect them.<br>
[20] At that time I will lead you—<br>
at the time I gather you together.<br>
Be sure of this! I will make all the nations of the earth respect and admire you<br>
when you see me restore you,” says the **Lord**.<br>
