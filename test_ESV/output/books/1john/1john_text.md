## ANTINOMIANISM

A _ntinomianism_ literally means “anti-lawism.” It denies or downplays the significance of God’s law in the life of the believer. It is the opposite of its twin heresy, legalism.

Antinomians acquire their distaste for the law in a number of ways. Some believe that they no longer are obligated to keep the moral law of God because Jesus has freed them from it. They insist that grace not only frees us from the curse of God’s law but delivers us from any obligation to obey God’s law. Grace then becomes a license for disobedience.

The astounding thing is that people hold this view despite Paul’s vigorous teaching against it. Paul, more than any other New Testament writer, emphasized the differences between law and grace. He gloried in the new covenant. Nevertheless, he was most explicit in his condemnation of antinomianism. In Rom. 3:31 he writes, “Do we then make void the law through faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we establish the law.”

Martin Luther, in expressing the doctrine of justification by faith alone, was charged with antinomianism. Yet he affirmed with James that “faith without works is dead.” Luther contested with his student Johann Agricola on this issue. Agricola denied that the law had any purpose in the life of the believer. He even denied that the law served to prepare the sinner for grace. Luther responded to Agricola with his work _Against the Antinomians_ in 1539. Agricola later recanted his antinomian teachings, but the issue remained.

Subsequent Lutheran theologians affirmed Luther’s view of the law. In the _Formula of Concord_ (1577), the last of the classical Lutheran statements of faith, they outlined three uses for the law: (1) to reveal sin; (2) to establish general decency in the society at large; and (3) to provide a rule of life for those regenerated through faith in Christ.

Antinomianism’s primary error is confusing justification with sanctification. We are justified by faith alone, apart from works. However, all believers grow in faith by keeping God’s holy commands—not to gain God’s favor, but out of loving gratitude for the grace already bestowed on them through the work of Christ.

It is a serious error to assume that the Old Testament was a covenant of law and the New Testament, a covenant of grace. The Old Testament is a monumental testimony to God’s amazing grace toward His people. Likewise, the New Testament is literally filled with commandments. We are not saved by the law, but we demonstrate our love for Christ by obeying His commandments. “If you love Me,” Jesus said, “keep My commandments” (John 14:15).

We frequently hear the statement, “Christianity isn’t a lot of do’s and don’ts; it is not a list of rules.” There is some truth in this deduction, inasmuch as Christianity is far more than a mere list of rules. It is, at its center, a personal relationship with Christ Himself. Yet Christianity is also not less than rules. The New Testament clearly includes some do’s and don’ts. Christianity is not a religion that sanctions the idea that everyone has the right to do what is right in his own eyes. On the contrary, Christianity never gives anyone the “right” to do what is wrong.

### The Word of Life

1 [✞] [†](#n1_Jn_CR1) That which was [†](#n1_Jn_CR2) from the beginning, [†](#n1_Jn_CR3) which we have heard, [†](#n1_Jn_CR4) which we have seen with our eyes, [†](#n1_Jn_CR5) which we looked upon and [†](#n1_Jn_CR6) have touched with our hands, concerning the word of life—

**2**  [†](#n1_Jn_CR7) the life [†](#n1_Jn_CR8) was made manifest, and we have seen it, and [†](#n1_Jn_CR9) testify to it and proclaim to you the eternal life, [†](#n1_Jn_CR10) which was with the Father and [†](#n1_Jn_CR8) was made manifest to us—

**3**  [†](#n1_Jn_CR11) that which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you, so that you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed [†](#n1_Jn_CR12) our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.

**4** [✞] And we are writing these things so [†](#n1_Jn_CR13) that our [*](#n1_Jn_NC1) joy may be complete.

**5** [✞] [†](#n1_Jn_CR14) This is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you, that [†](#n1_Jn_CR15) God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.

**6**  [†](#n1_Jn_CR16) If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and [†](#n1_Jn_CR17) do not practice the truth.

**7** [✞] But [†](#n1_Jn_CR18) if we walk in the light, [†](#n1_Jn_CR19) as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and [†](#n1_Jn_CR20) the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.

**8**  [†](#n1_Jn_CR21) If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and [†](#n1_Jn_CR22) the truth is not in us.

**9** [✞] [†](#n1_Jn_CR23) If we confess our sins, he is [†](#n1_Jn_CR24) faithful and just to forgive us our sins and [†](#n1_Jn_CR25) to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

**10** [✞] If we say we have not sinned, [†](#n1_Jn_CR26) we make him a liar, and [†](#n1_Jn_CR27) his word is not in us.2 [✞] My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, [†](#n1_Jn_CR28) we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.

**2** [✞] [†](#n1_Jn_CR29) He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but [†](#n1_Jn_CR30) also for the sins of the whole world.

**3**  And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we [†](#n1_Jn_CR31) keep his commandments.

**4**  Whoever says “I know him” but does not keep his commandments [†](#n1_Jn_CR32) is a liar, and [†](#n1_Jn_CR32) the truth is not in him,

**5**  but whoever [†](#n1_Jn_CR33) keeps his word, in him truly [†](#n1_Jn_CR34) the love of God is perfected. [†](#n1_Jn_CR35) By this we may know that we are in him:

**6** [✞] whoever says he [†](#n1_Jn_CR36) abides in him [†](#n1_Jn_CR37) ought to walk in the same way in which he walked.

**7** [✞] Beloved, I am writing you [†](#n1_Jn_CR38) no new commandment, but [†](#n1_Jn_CR39) an old commandment [†](#n1_Jn_CR40) that you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word that you have heard.

**8**  At the same time, it is [†](#n1_Jn_CR41) a new commandment that I am writing to you, which is true in him and in you, because [*](#n1_Jn_NC2) [†](#n1_Jn_CR42) the darkness is passing away and [†](#n1_Jn_CR43) the true light is already shining.

**9**  Whoever says he is in the light and [†](#n1_Jn_CR44) hates his brother is still in darkness.

**10**  Whoever loves his brother abides in the light, and in him [*](#n1_Jn_NC3) there is no [†](#n1_Jn_CR45) cause for stumbling.

**11**  But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and [†](#n1_Jn_CR46) walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.

  > because [†](#n1_Jn_CR47) your sins are forgiven for his name’s sake.

  > because you know [†](#n1_Jn_CR48) him who is from the beginning.

> I am writing to you, young men,

  > because [†](#n1_Jn_CR49) you have overcome the evil one.

> I write to you, children,

  > because [†](#n1_Jn_CR50) you know the Father.

  > because you know [†](#n1_Jn_CR51) him who is from the beginning.

> I write to you, young men,

  > because [†](#n1_Jn_CR52) you are strong,

  > and the word of God abides in you,

  > and you have overcome the evil one.

**15** [✞] [†](#n1_Jn_CR53) Do not love the world or the things in the world. [†](#n1_Jn_CR54) If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.

**16** [✞] For all that is in the world—[†](#n1_Jn_CR55) the desires of the flesh and [†](#n1_Jn_CR56) the desires of the eyes and pride of life [*](#n1_Jn_NC4)—is not from the Father but is from the world.

**17** [✞] And [†](#n1_Jn_CR57) the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever.

**18** [✞] Children, [†](#n1_Jn_CR58) it is the last hour, and as you have heard that [†](#n1_Jn_CR59) antichrist is coming, so now [†](#n1_Jn_CR60) many antichrists have come. [†](#n1_Jn_CR61) Therefore we know that it is the last hour.

**19** [✞] [†](#n1_Jn_CR62) They went out from us, but they were not of us; for [†](#n1_Jn_CR63) if they had been of us, they would have continued with us. But they went out, [†](#n1_Jn_CR64) that it might become plain that they all are not of us.

**20** [✞] But you have been [†](#n1_Jn_CR65) anointed by [†](#n1_Jn_CR66) the Holy One, and [†](#n1_Jn_CR67) you all have knowledge. [*](#n1_Jn_NC5)

**21**  I write to you, not because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth.

**22** [✞] Who is the liar but [†](#n1_Jn_CR68) he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is [†](#n1_Jn_CR69) the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son.

**23**  [†](#n1_Jn_CR70) No one who denies the Son has the Father. Whoever confesses the Son has the Father also.

**24**  Let [†](#n1_Jn_CR71) what you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then [†](#n1_Jn_CR72) you too will abide in the Son and in the Father.

**25** [✞] And this is the promise that he made to us [*](#n1_Jn_NC6)—[†](#n1_Jn_CR73) eternal life.

**26**  I write these things to you about [†](#n1_Jn_CR74) those who are trying to deceive you.

**27** [✞] But [†](#n1_Jn_CR75) the anointing that you received from him abides in you, and [†](#n1_Jn_CR76) you have no need that anyone should teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about everything, and [†](#n1_Jn_CR77) is true, and is no lie—just as it has taught you, abide in him.

**28** [✞] And now, little children, abide in him, so that [†](#n1_Jn_CR78) when he appears [†](#n1_Jn_CR79) we may have confidence and not shrink from him in shame at his [†](#n1_Jn_CR80) coming.

**29** [✞] If you know that [†](#n1_Jn_CR81) he is righteous, you may be sure that [†](#n1_Jn_CR82) everyone who practices righteousness has been born of him.3 See [†](#n1_Jn_CR83) what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called [†](#n1_Jn_CR84) children of God; and so we are. The reason why [†](#n1_Jn_CR85) the world does not know us is that [†](#n1_Jn_CR86) it did not know him.

**2**  Beloved, we are [†](#n1_Jn_CR87) God’s children [†](#n1_Jn_CR88) now, and what we will be [†](#n1_Jn_CR89) has not yet appeared; but we know that [†](#n1_Jn_CR90) when he appears [*](#n1_Jn_NC7) [†](#n1_Jn_CR91) we shall be like him, because [†](#n1_Jn_CR92) we shall see him as he is.

**3** [✞] And everyone who [†](#n1_Jn_CR93) thus hopes in him [†](#n1_Jn_CR94) purifies himself as he is pure.

**4** [✞] Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; [†](#n1_Jn_CR95) sin is lawlessness.

**5**  You know that [†](#n1_Jn_CR96) he appeared in order to [†](#n1_Jn_CR97) take away sins, and [†](#n1_Jn_CR98) in him there is no sin.

**6** [✞] No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; [†](#n1_Jn_CR99) no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him.

**7** [✞] Little children, [†](#n1_Jn_CR100) let no one deceive you. [†](#n1_Jn_CR101) Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.

**8** [✞] [†](#n1_Jn_CR102) Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was [†](#n1_Jn_CR103) to destroy the works of the devil.

**9**  [†](#n1_Jn_CR104) No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God’s [*](#n1_Jn_NC8) seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God.

**10**  By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, [†](#n1_Jn_CR105) nor is the one who [†](#n1_Jn_CR106) does not love his brother.

**11** [✞] For [†](#n1_Jn_CR107) this is the message that you have heard from the beginning, [†](#n1_Jn_CR108) that we should love one another.

**12** [✞] We should not be like [†](#n1_Jn_CR109) Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? [†](#n1_Jn_CR110) Because his own deeds were evil and his brother’s righteous.

**13**  Do not be surprised, brothers, [*](#n1_Jn_NC9) [†](#n1_Jn_CR111) that the world hates you.

**14**  We know that [†](#n1_Jn_CR112) we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. Whoever does not love abides in death.

**15**  [†](#n1_Jn_CR113) Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that [†](#n1_Jn_CR114) no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.

**16** [✞] By this we know love, that [†](#n1_Jn_CR115) he laid down his life for us, and [†](#n1_Jn_CR116) we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.

**17**  But [†](#n1_Jn_CR117) if anyone has the world’s goods and sees his brother in need, yet [†](#n1_Jn_CR118) closes his heart against him, [†](#n1_Jn_CR119) how does God’s love abide in him?

**18**  Little children, let us not [†](#n1_Jn_CR120) love in word or talk but in deed and [†](#n1_Jn_CR121) in truth.

**19**  By this we shall know that we are of the truth and reassure our heart before him;

**20** [✞] for whenever our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and he knows everything.

**21**  Beloved, [†](#n1_Jn_CR122) if our heart does not condemn us, [†](#n1_Jn_CR123) we have confidence before God;

**22** [✞] and [†](#n1_Jn_CR124) whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and [†](#n1_Jn_CR125) do what pleases him.

**23** [✞] And this is his commandment, [†](#n1_Jn_CR126) that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and [†](#n1_Jn_CR127) love one another, [†](#n1_Jn_CR128) just as he has commanded us.

**24**  [†](#n1_Jn_CR129) Whoever keeps his commandments abides in God, [*](#n1_Jn_NC10) and God [*](#n1_Jn_NC11) in him. And [†](#n1_Jn_CR130) by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit whom he has given us.4 [✞] Beloved, [†](#n1_Jn_CR131) do not believe every spirit, but [†](#n1_Jn_CR132) test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for [†](#n1_Jn_CR133) many [†](#n1_Jn_CR134) false prophets [†](#n1_Jn_CR135) have gone out into the world.

**2** [✞] By this you know the Spirit of God: [†](#n1_Jn_CR136) every spirit that confesses that [†](#n1_Jn_CR137) Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,

**3** [✞] and every spirit [†](#n1_Jn_CR138) that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming and [†](#n1_Jn_CR139) now is in the world already.

**4** [✞] Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for [†](#n1_Jn_CR140) he who is in you is greater than [†](#n1_Jn_CR141) he who is in the world.

**5**  [†](#n1_Jn_CR142) They are from the world; therefore they speak from the world, and [†](#n1_Jn_CR143) the world listens to them.

**6** [✞] We are from God. [†](#n1_Jn_CR144) Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know [†](#n1_Jn_CR145) the Spirit of truth and [†](#n1_Jn_CR146) the spirit of error.

**7** [✞] Beloved, [†](#n1_Jn_CR147) let us love one another, for love is from God, and [†](#n1_Jn_CR148) whoever loves has been born of God and knows God.

**8**  [†](#n1_Jn_CR149) Anyone who does not love does not know God, because [†](#n1_Jn_CR150) God is love.

**9** [✞] In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that [†](#n1_Jn_CR151) God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him.

**10** [✞] In this is love, [†](#n1_Jn_CR152) not that we have loved God [†](#n1_Jn_CR153) but that he loved us and sent his Son to be [†](#n1_Jn_CR154) the propitiation for our sins.

**11**  Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.

**12**  [†](#n1_Jn_CR155) No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and [†](#n1_Jn_CR156) his love is perfected in us.

**13**  [†](#n1_Jn_CR157) By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.

**14** [✞] And [†](#n1_Jn_CR158) we have seen and testify that [†](#n1_Jn_CR159) the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of [†](#n1_Jn_CR160) the world.

**15**  [†](#n1_Jn_CR161) Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.

**16** [✞] So [†](#n1_Jn_CR162) we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. [†](#n1_Jn_CR163) God is love, and [†](#n1_Jn_CR164) whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.

**17** [✞] By this [†](#n1_Jn_CR165) is love perfected with us, so that [†](#n1_Jn_CR166) we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because [†](#n1_Jn_CR167) as he is so also are we in this world.

**18** [✞] There is no fear in love, but [†](#n1_Jn_CR168) perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not [†](#n1_Jn_CR169) been perfected in love.

**19**  [†](#n1_Jn_CR170) We love because he first loved us.

**20**  [†](#n1_Jn_CR171) If anyone says, “I love God,” and [†](#n1_Jn_CR172) hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot [*](#n1_Jn_NC12) love God [†](#n1_Jn_CR173) whom he has not seen.

**21**  And [†](#n1_Jn_CR174) this commandment we have from him: [†](#n1_Jn_CR175) whoever loves God must also love his brother.5 [✞] [†](#n1_Jn_CR176) Everyone who believes that [†](#n1_Jn_CR177) Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and [†](#n1_Jn_CR178) everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of him.

**2**  [†](#n1_Jn_CR179) By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments.

**3** [✞] For [†](#n1_Jn_CR180) this is the love of God, that we [†](#n1_Jn_CR181) keep his commandments. And [†](#n1_Jn_CR182) his commandments are not burdensome.

**4** [✞] For [†](#n1_Jn_CR183) everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world—[†](#n1_Jn_CR184) our faith.

**5**  Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes [†](#n1_Jn_CR185) that Jesus is the Son of God?

**6** [✞] This is he who came [†](#n1_Jn_CR186) by water and blood—Jesus Christ; not by the water only but by the water and the blood. And [†](#n1_Jn_CR187) the Spirit is the one who testifies, because [†](#n1_Jn_CR188) the Spirit is the truth.

**7** [✞] For there are three that testify:

**8**  the Spirit and the water and the blood; and these three agree.

**9** [✞] [†](#n1_Jn_CR189) If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater, for this is the testimony of God [†](#n1_Jn_CR190) that he has borne concerning his Son.

**10**  Whoever believes in the Son of God [†](#n1_Jn_CR191) has the testimony in himself. Whoever does not believe God [†](#n1_Jn_CR192) has made him a liar, [†](#n1_Jn_CR193) because he has not believed in the testimony that God has borne concerning his Son.

**11** [✞] And this is the testimony, that God gave us [†](#n1_Jn_CR194) eternal life, and [†](#n1_Jn_CR195) this life is in his Son.

**12**  [†](#n1_Jn_CR196) Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.

**13** [✞] I write [†](#n1_Jn_CR197) these things to you who [†](#n1_Jn_CR198) believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life.

**14**  And this is [†](#n1_Jn_CR199) the confidence that we have toward him, that [†](#n1_Jn_CR200) if we ask anything according to his will he hears us.

**15**  And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests that we have asked of him.

**16** [✞] If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and [†](#n1_Jn_CR201) God [*](#n1_Jn_NC13) will give him life—to those who commit sins that do not lead to death. [†](#n1_Jn_CR202) There is sin that leads to death; [†](#n1_Jn_CR203) I do not say that one should pray for that.

**17**  [†](#n1_Jn_CR204) All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that does not lead to death.

**18** [✞] We know that [†](#n1_Jn_CR205) everyone who has been born of God does not keep on sinning, but [†](#n1_Jn_CR206) he who was born of God [†](#n1_Jn_CR207) protects him, and the evil one does not touch him.

**19** [✞] We know that we are from God, and [†](#n1_Jn_CR208) the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.

**20** [✞] And we know that the Son of God has come and [†](#n1_Jn_CR209) has given us understanding, so that we may know [†](#n1_Jn_CR210) him who is true; and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and [†](#n1_Jn_CR211) eternal life.

**21**  Little children, [†](#n1_Jn_CR212) keep yourselves from idols.
