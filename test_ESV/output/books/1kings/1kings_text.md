### David in His Old Age

1 [✞] Now King David was old and advanced in years. And although they covered him with clothes, he could not get warm.

**2**  Therefore his servants said to him, “Let a young woman be sought for my lord the king, and let her wait on the king and be in his service. Let her lie in your arms, [*](#n1_Kgs_NC1) that my lord the king may be warm.”

**3** [✞] So they sought for a beautiful young woman throughout all the territory of Israel, and found Abishag the [†](#n1_Kgs_CR1) Shunammite, and brought her to the king.

**4** [✞] The young woman was very beautiful, and she was of service to the king and attended to him, but the king knew her not.

**5** [✞] Now [†](#n1_Kgs_CR2) Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, “I will be king.” [†](#n1_Kgs_CR3) And he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.

**6** [✞] His father had never at any time displeased him by asking, “Why have you done thus and so?” He was also a very handsome man, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR4) and he was born next after Absalom.

**7** [✞] He conferred with [†](#n1_Kgs_CR5) Joab the son of Zeruiah and with [†](#n1_Kgs_CR6) Abiathar the priest. And they followed Adonijah and helped him.

**8** [✞] But [†](#n1_Kgs_CR7) Zadok the priest and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR8) Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR9) Nathan the prophet and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR10) Shimei and Rei and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR11) David’s mighty men were not with Adonijah.

**9** [✞] Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fattened cattle by the Serpent’s Stone, which is beside [†](#n1_Kgs_CR12) En-rogel, and he invited all his brothers, the king’s sons, and all the royal officials of Judah,

**10**  but he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the mighty men or [†](#n1_Kgs_CR13) Solomon his brother.

**11** [✞] Then Nathan said to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, “Have you not heard that [†](#n1_Kgs_CR14) Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king and David our lord does not know it?

**12** [✞] Now therefore come, let me give you advice, that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.

**13** [✞] Go in at once to King David, and say to him, ‘Did you not, my lord the king, swear to your servant, saying, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR15) “Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne”? Why then is Adonijah king?’

**14**  Then while you are still speaking with the king, I also will come in after you and confirm [*](#n1_Kgs_NC2) your words.”

**15**  So Bathsheba went to the king in his chamber (now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was attending to the king).

**16**  Bathsheba bowed and paid homage to the king, and the king said, “What do you desire?”

**17** [✞] She said to him, “My lord, you swore to your servant by the L**ORD** your God, saying, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR16) ‘Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.’

**18**  And now, behold, Adonijah is king, although you, my lord the king, do not know it.

**19**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR17) He has sacrificed oxen, fattened cattle, and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the sons of the king, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR18) Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of the army, but [†](#n1_Kgs_CR19) Solomon your servant he has not invited.

**20** [✞] And now, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, to tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.

**21**  Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king [†](#n1_Kgs_CR20) sleeps with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be counted offenders.”

**22**  While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.

**23**  And they told the king, “Here is Nathan the prophet.” And when he came in before the king, he bowed before the king, with his face to the ground.

**24** [✞] And Nathan said, “My lord the king, have you said, ‘Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne’?

**25**  For he has gone down this day and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR21) has sacrificed oxen, fattened cattle, and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king’s sons, the commanders [*](#n1_Kgs_NC3) of the army, and Abiathar the priest. And behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and saying, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR22) ‘Long live King Adonijah!’

**26**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR23) But me, your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon he has not invited.

**27**  Has this thing been brought about by my lord the king and you have not told your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?”

**28**  Then King David answered, “Call Bathsheba to me.” So she came into the king’s presence and stood before the king.

**29**  And the king swore, saying, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR24) “As the L**ORD** lives, who has redeemed my soul out of every adversity,

**30** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR25) as I swore to you by the L**ORD**, the God of Israel, saying, ‘Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place,’ even so will I do this day.”

**31**  Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground and paid homage to the king and said, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR26) “May my lord King David live forever!”

**32**  King David said, “Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.” So they came before the king.

**33** [✞] And the king said to them, “Take with you [†](#n1_Kgs_CR27) the servants of your lord and have Solomon my son ride on my own mule, and bring him down to [†](#n1_Kgs_CR28) Gihon.

**34** [✞] And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet there [†](#n1_Kgs_CR29) anoint him king over Israel. [†](#n1_Kgs_CR30) Then blow the trumpet and say, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR31) ‘Long live King Solomon!’

**35** [✞] You shall then come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne, for he shall be king in my place. And I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.”

**36**  And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, “Amen! May the L**ORD**, the God of my lord the king, say so.

**37**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR32) As the L**ORD** has been with my lord the king, even so may he be with Solomon, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR33) and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David.”

**38** [✞] So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR34) and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on King David’s mule and brought him to Gihon.

**39** [✞] There Zadok the priest took the horn of [†](#n1_Kgs_CR35) oil from the tent and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR36) anointed Solomon. [†](#n1_Kgs_CR37) Then they blew the trumpet, and all the people said, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR38) “Long live King Solomon!”

**40**  And all the people went up after him, playing on pipes, and rejoicing with great joy, so that the earth was split by their noise.

**41** [✞] Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they finished feasting. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, “What does this uproar in the city mean?”

**42**  While he was still speaking, behold, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR39) Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came. And Adonijah said, “Come in, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR40) for you are a worthy man and bring good news.”

**43**  Jonathan answered Adonijah, “No, for our lord King David has made Solomon king,

**44**  and the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the [†](#n1_Kgs_CR41) Cherethites and the Pelethites. And they had him ride on the king’s mule.

**45**  And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at [†](#n1_Kgs_CR42) Gihon, and they have gone up from there rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This is the noise that you have heard.

**46**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR43) Solomon sits on the royal throne.

**47** [✞] Moreover, the king’s servants came to congratulate our lord King David, saying, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR44) ‘May your God make the name of Solomon more famous than yours, and make his throne greater than your throne.’ And the king [†](#n1_Kgs_CR45) bowed himself on the bed.

**48**  And the king also said, ‘Blessed be the L**ORD**, the God of Israel, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR46) who has granted someone [*](#n1_Kgs_NC4) to sit on my throne this day, my own eyes seeing it.’”

**49** [✞] Then all the guests of Adonijah trembled and rose, and each went his own way.

**50** [✞] And Adonijah feared Solomon. So he arose and went [†](#n1_Kgs_CR47) and took hold of [†](#n1_Kgs_CR48) the horns of the altar.

**51**  Then it was told Solomon, “Behold, Adonijah fears King Solomon, for behold, he has laid hold of the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let King Solomon swear to me first that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.’”

**52** [✞] And Solomon said, “If he will show himself a worthy man, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR49) not one of his hairs shall fall to the earth, but if wickedness is found in him, he shall die.”

**53**  So King Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and paid homage to King Solomon, and Solomon said to him, “Go to your house.”2 [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR50) When David’s time to die drew near, he commanded Solomon his son, saying,

**2** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR51) “I am about to go the way of all the earth. [†](#n1_Kgs_CR52) Be strong, and show yourself a man,

**3** [✞] and keep the charge of the L**ORD** your God, walking in his ways and keeping his statutes, his commandments, his rules, and his testimonies, as it is written in the Law of Moses, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR53) that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn,

**4** [✞] that the L**ORD** may [†](#n1_Kgs_CR54) establish his word that he spoke concerning me, saying, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR55) ‘If your sons pay close attention to their way, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR56) to walk before me in faithfulness with all their heart and with all their soul, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR57) you shall not lack [*](#n1_Kgs_NC5) a man on the throne of Israel.’

**5** [✞] “Moreover, you also know what Joab the son of Zeruiah [†](#n1_Kgs_CR58) did to me, how he dealt with the two commanders of the armies of Israel, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR59) Abner the son of Ner, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR60) and Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed, avenging [*](#n1_Kgs_NC6) in time of peace for blood that had been shed in war, and putting the blood of war [*](#n1_Kgs_NC7) on the belt around his [*](#n1_Kgs_NC8) waist and on the sandals on his feet.

**6**  Act therefore [†](#n1_Kgs_CR61) according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace.

**7** [✞] But deal loyally with the sons of [†](#n1_Kgs_CR62) Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be [†](#n1_Kgs_CR63) among those who eat at your table, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR64) for with such loyalty [*](#n1_Kgs_NC9) they met me when I fled from Absalom your brother.

**8** [✞] And there is also with you [†](#n1_Kgs_CR65) Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse on the day [†](#n1_Kgs_CR66) when I went to Mahanaim. [†](#n1_Kgs_CR67) But when he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the L**ORD**, saying, ‘I will not put you to death with the sword.’

**9** [✞] Now therefore do not hold him guiltless, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR68) for you are a wise man. You will know what you ought to do to him, and you shall [†](#n1_Kgs_CR69) bring his gray head down with blood to Sheol.”

**10** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR70) Then David slept with his fathers and was buried in [†](#n1_Kgs_CR71) the city of David.

**11** [✞] And the time that David reigned over Israel was [†](#n1_Kgs_CR72) forty years. He reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.

**12**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR73) So Solomon sat on the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was firmly established.

**13**  Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR74) “Do you come peacefully?” He said, “Peacefully.”

**14**  Then he said, “I have something to say to you.” She said, “Speak.”

**15** [✞] He said, “You know that [†](#n1_Kgs_CR75) the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel fully expected me to reign. However, the kingdom has turned about and become my brother’s, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR76) for it was his from the L**ORD**.

**16**  And now I have one request to make of you; do not refuse me.” She said to him, “Speak.”

**17** [✞] And he said, “Please ask King Solomon—he will not refuse you—to give me [†](#n1_Kgs_CR77) Abishag the Shunammite as my wife.”

**18** [✞] Bathsheba said, “Very well; I will speak for you to the king.”

**19** [✞] So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him on behalf of Adonijah. And the king rose to meet her and bowed down to her. Then he sat on his throne and had a seat brought for the king’s mother, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR78) and she sat on his right.

**20**  Then she said, “I have one small request to make of you; do not refuse me.” And the king said to her, “Make your request, my mother, for I will not refuse you.”

**21**  She said, “Let [†](#n1_Kgs_CR79) Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as his wife.”

**22** [✞] King Solomon answered his mother, “And why do you ask [†](#n1_Kgs_CR80) Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR81) for he is my older brother, and on his side [†](#n1_Kgs_CR82) are Abiathar [*](#n1_Kgs_NC10) the priest and Joab the son of Zeruiah.”

**23**  Then King Solomon swore by the L**ORD**, saying, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR83) “God do so to me and more also if this word does not cost Adonijah his life!

**24** [✞] Now therefore [†](#n1_Kgs_CR84) as the L**ORD** lives, who has established me and placed me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR85) as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death today.”

**25**  So King Solomon sent [†](#n1_Kgs_CR86) Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he struck him down, and he died.

**26** [✞] And to Abiathar the priest the king said, “Go to [†](#n1_Kgs_CR87) Anathoth, to your estate, for you deserve death. But I will not at this time put you to death, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR88) because you carried the ark of the Lord **GOD** before David my father, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR89) and because you shared in all my father’s affliction.”

**27** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR90) So Solomon expelled Abiathar from being priest to the L**ORD**, thus fulfilling [†](#n1_Kgs_CR91) the word of the L**ORD** that he had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.

**28** [✞] When the news came to Joab—for Joab [†](#n1_Kgs_CR92) had supported Adonijah although [†](#n1_Kgs_CR93) he had not supported Absalom—Joab fled to the tent of the L**ORD** and caught hold of the [†](#n1_Kgs_CR94) horns of the altar.

**29** [✞] And when it was told King Solomon, “Joab has fled to the tent of the L**ORD**, and behold, he is beside the altar,” Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, “Go, strike him down.”

**30** [✞] So Benaiah came to the tent of the L**ORD** and said to him, “The king commands, ‘Come out.’” But he said, “No, I will die here.” Then Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, “Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.”

**31** [✞] The king replied to him, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR95) “Do as he has said, strike him down and bury him, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR96) and thus take away from me and from my father’s house the guilt for the blood that Joab shed without cause.

**32** [✞] The L**ORD** will [†](#n1_Kgs_CR97) bring back his bloody deeds on his own head, because, without the knowledge of my father David, he attacked and killed with the sword two men [†](#n1_Kgs_CR98) more righteous and better than himself, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR99) Abner the son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel, and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR100) Amasa the son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah.

**33**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR101) So shall their blood come back on the head of Joab and on the head of his descendants forever. But for David and for his descendants and for his house and for his throne there shall be peace from the L**ORD** forevermore.”

**34**  Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and struck him down and put him to death. And he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.

**35** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR102) The king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada over the army in place of Joab, and the king put [†](#n1_Kgs_CR103) Zadok the priest [†](#n1_Kgs_CR104) in the place of Abiathar.

**36** [✞] Then the king sent and summoned [†](#n1_Kgs_CR105) Shimei and said to him, “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and dwell there, and do not go out from there to any place whatever.

**37**  For on the day you go out and cross [†](#n1_Kgs_CR106) the brook Kidron, know for certain that you shall die. [†](#n1_Kgs_CR107) Your blood shall be on your own head.”

**38**  And Shimei said to the king, “What you say is good; as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do.” So Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days.

**39** [✞] But it happened at the end of three years that two of Shimei’s servants ran away to [†](#n1_Kgs_CR108) Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. And when it was told Shimei, “Behold, your servants are in Gath,”

**40**  Shimei arose and saddled a donkey and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants. Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath.

**41**  And when Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and returned,

**42**  the king sent and summoned Shimei and said to him, “Did I not make you swear by the L**ORD** and solemnly warn you, saying, ‘Know for certain that on the day you go out and go to any place whatever, you shall die’? And you said to me, ‘What you say is good; I will obey.’

**43**  Why then have you not kept your oath to the L**ORD** and the commandment with which I commanded you?”

**44**  The king also said to Shimei, “You know in your own heart [†](#n1_Kgs_CR109) all the harm that you did to David my father. So the L**ORD** will [†](#n1_Kgs_CR110) bring back your harm on your own head.

**45**  But King Solomon shall be blessed, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR111) and the throne of David shall be established before the L**ORD** forever.”

**46**  Then the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck him down, and he died.[†](#n1_Kgs_CR112) So the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.3 [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR113) Solomon made a marriage alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt. He took Pharaoh’s daughter and brought her into [†](#n1_Kgs_CR114) the city of David until he had finished [†](#n1_Kgs_CR115) building his own house [†](#n1_Kgs_CR116) and the house of the L**ORD** [†](#n1_Kgs_CR117) and the wall around Jerusalem.

**2** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR118) The people were sacrificing at the high places, however, because no house had yet been built for the name of the L**ORD**.

**3** [✞] Solomon [†](#n1_Kgs_CR119) loved the L**ORD**, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR120) walking in the statutes of David his father, only he sacrificed and made offerings at the high places.

**4** [✞] And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR121) for that was the great high place. Solomon used to offer a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.

**5** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR122) At Gibeon [†](#n1_Kgs_CR123) the L**ORD** appeared to Solomon [†](#n1_Kgs_CR124) in a dream by night, and God said, “Ask what I shall give you.”

**6**  And Solomon said, “You have shown great and steadfast love to your servant David my father, because [†](#n1_Kgs_CR125) he walked before you in faithfulness, in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart toward you. And you have kept for him this great and steadfast love and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR126) have given him a son to sit on his throne this day.

**7** [✞] And now, O L**ORD** my God, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR127) you have made your servant king in place of David my father, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR128) although I am but a little child. I do not know [†](#n1_Kgs_CR129) how to go out or come in.

**8** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR130) And your servant is in the midst of your people whom you have chosen, a great people, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR131) too many to be numbered or counted for multitude.

**9**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR132) Give your servant therefore an understanding mind [†](#n1_Kgs_CR133) to govern your people, that I may [†](#n1_Kgs_CR134) discern between good and evil, for who is able to govern this your great people?”

**10** [✞] It pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this.

**11**  And God said to him, “Because you have asked this, and have not asked for yourself long life or riches or the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern what is right,

**12** [✞] behold, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR135) I now do according to your word. Behold, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR136) I give you a wise and discerning mind, so that none like you has been before you and none like you shall arise after you.

**13**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR137) I give you also what you have not asked, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR138) both riches and honor, so that no other king shall compare with you, all your days.

**14** [✞] And if you will walk in my ways, keeping my statutes and my commandments, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR139) as your father David walked, then [†](#n1_Kgs_CR140) I will lengthen your days.”

**15** [✞] And Solomon [†](#n1_Kgs_CR141) awoke, and behold, it was a dream. Then he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered up burnt offerings and peace offerings, and made a feast for all his servants.

**16** [✞] Then two prostitutes came to the king [†](#n1_Kgs_CR142) and stood before him.

**17**  The one woman said, “Oh, my lord, this woman and I live in the same house, and I gave birth to a child while she was in the house.

**18**  Then on the third day after I gave birth, this woman also gave birth. And we were alone. There was no one else with us in the house; only we two were in the house.

**19**  And this woman’s son died in the night, because she lay on him.

**20**  And she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me, while your servant slept, and laid him at her breast, and laid her dead son at my breast.

**21**  When I rose in the morning to nurse my child, behold, he was dead. But when I looked at him closely in the morning, behold, he was not the child that I had borne.”

**22**  But the other woman said, “No, the living child is mine, and the dead child is yours.” The first said, “No, the dead child is yours, and the living child is mine.” Thus they spoke before the king.

**23**  Then the king said, “The one says, ‘This is my son that is alive, and your son is dead’; and the other says, ‘No; but your son is dead, and my son is the living one.’”

**24** [✞] And the king said, “Bring me a sword.” So a sword was brought before the king.

**25** [✞] And the king said, “Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one and half to the other.”

**26**  Then the woman whose son was alive said to the king, because [†](#n1_Kgs_CR143) her heart yearned for her son, “Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and by no means put him to death.” But the other said, “He shall be neither mine nor yours; divide him.”

**27**  Then the king answered and said, “Give the living child to the first woman, and by no means put him to death; she is his mother.”

**28** [✞] And all Israel heard of the judgment that the king had rendered, and they stood in awe of the king, because they perceived that [†](#n1_Kgs_CR144) the wisdom of God was in him to do justice.4 [✞] King Solomon was king over all Israel,

**2** [✞] and these were his high officials: Azariah the son of Zadok was [†](#n1_Kgs_CR145) the priest;

**3**  Elihoreph and Ahijah the sons of Shisha were secretaries; [†](#n1_Kgs_CR146) Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;

**4** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR147) Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was in command of the army; [†](#n1_Kgs_CR148) Zadok and Abiathar were priests;

**5** [✞] Azariah the son of Nathan was over [†](#n1_Kgs_CR149) the officers; Zabud the son of Nathan was priest and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR150) king’s friend;

**6** [✞] Ahishar was in charge of the palace; and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR151) Adoniram the son of Abda was in charge of [†](#n1_Kgs_CR152) the forced labor.

**7** [✞] Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided food for the king and his household. Each man had to make provision for one month in the year.

**8**  These were their names: Ben-hur, in [†](#n1_Kgs_CR153) the hill country of Ephraim;

**9**  Ben-deker, in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth-shemesh, and Elonbeth-hanan;

**10**  Ben-hesed, in Arubboth (to him belonged Socoh and all the land of Hepher);

**11**  Ben-abinadab, in all [†](#n1_Kgs_CR154) Naphath-dor (he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon as his wife);

**12** [✞] Baana the son of Ahilud, in [†](#n1_Kgs_CR155) Taanach, Megiddo, and all [†](#n1_Kgs_CR155) Beth-shean that is beside Zarethan below Jezreel, and from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, as far as the other side of Jokmeam;

**13**  Ben-geber, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR156) in Ramoth-gilead (he had [†](#n1_Kgs_CR157) the villages of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead, and he had [†](#n1_Kgs_CR158) the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars);

**14**  Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;

**15**  Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he had taken Basemath the daughter of Solomon as his wife);

**16**  Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth;

**17**  Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar;

**18**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR159) Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin;

**19** [✞] Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR160) the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan. And there was one governor who was over the land.

**20** [✞] Judah and Israel were as many [†](#n1_Kgs_CR161) as the sand by the sea. They ate and drank and were happy.

**21** [✞] [*](#n1_Kgs_NC11) [†](#n1_Kgs_CR162) Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the [†](#n1_Kgs_CR163) Euphrates [*](#n1_Kgs_NC12) to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt. [†](#n1_Kgs_CR164) They brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life.

**22** [✞] Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty cors [*](#n1_Kgs_NC13) of fine flour and sixty cors of meal,

**23**  ten fat oxen, and twenty pasture-fed cattle, a hundred sheep, besides deer, gazelles, roebucks, and fattened fowl.

**24** [✞] For he had dominion over all the region west of the Euphrates [*](#n1_Kgs_NC14) from Tiphsah to [†](#n1_Kgs_CR165) Gaza, over all the kings west of the Euphrates. [†](#n1_Kgs_CR166) And he had peace on all sides around him.

**25**  And Judah and Israel [†](#n1_Kgs_CR167) lived in safety, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR168) from Dan even to Beersheba, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR169) every man under his vine and under his fig tree, all the days of Solomon.

**26** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR170) Solomon also had 40,000 [*](#n1_Kgs_NC15) stalls of horses for his chariots, and 12,000 horsemen.

**27**  And those officers supplied provisions for King Solomon, and for all who came to King Solomon’s table, each one in his month. They let nothing be lacking.

**28**  Barley also and straw for the horses and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR171) swift steeds they brought to the place where it was required, each according to his duty.

**29**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR172) And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding beyond measure, and breadth of mind [†](#n1_Kgs_CR173) like the sand on the seashore,

**30** [✞] so that Solomon’s wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all [†](#n1_Kgs_CR174) the people of the east [†](#n1_Kgs_CR175) and all the wisdom of Egypt.

**31**  For he was [†](#n1_Kgs_CR176) wiser than all other men, wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol, and his fame was in all the surrounding nations.

**32** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR177) He also spoke 3,000 proverbs, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR178) and his songs were 1,005.

**33** [✞] He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon to the hyssop that grows out of the wall. He spoke also of beasts, and of birds, and of reptiles, and of fish.

**34** [✞] And people of all nations came to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and from [†](#n1_Kgs_CR179) all the kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.5 [✞] [*](#n1_Kgs_NC16) Now [†](#n1_Kgs_CR180) Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon when he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR181) for Hiram always loved David.

**2**  And Solomon sent word to Hiram,

**3** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR182) “You know that David my father could not build a house for the name of the L**ORD** his God [†](#n1_Kgs_CR183) because of the warfare with which his enemies surrounded him, until the L**ORD** put them under the soles of his feet.

**4** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR184) But now the L**ORD** my God has given me rest on every side. There is neither adversary nor misfortune.

**5** [✞] And so I intend to build a house for the name of the L**ORD** my God, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR185) as the L**ORD** said to David my father, ‘Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, shall build the house for my name.’

**6** [✞] Now therefore command that cedars of Lebanon be cut for me. And my servants will join your servants, and I will pay you for your servants such wages as you set, for you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.”

**7** [✞] As soon as Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly and said, “Blessed be the L**ORD** this day, who has given to David a wise son to be over this great people.”

**8**  And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, “I have heard the message that you have sent to me. I am ready to do all you desire in the matter of cedar and cypress timber.

**9** [✞] My servants shall bring it down to the sea from Lebanon, and I will make it into rafts to go by sea to the place you direct. And I will have them broken up there, and you shall receive it. And you shall meet my wishes [†](#n1_Kgs_CR186) by providing food for my household.”

**10**  So Hiram supplied Solomon with all the timber of cedar and cypress that he desired,

**11**  while Solomon gave Hiram 20,000 cors [*](#n1_Kgs_NC17) of wheat as food for his household, and 20,000 [*](#n1_Kgs_NC18) cors of beaten oil. Solomon gave this to Hiram year by year.

**12** [✞] And the L**ORD** gave Solomon wisdom, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR187) as he promised him. And there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty.

**13** [✞] King Solomon drafted [†](#n1_Kgs_CR188) forced labor out of all Israel, and the draft numbered 30,000 men.

**14** [✞] And he sent them to Lebanon, 10,000 a month in shifts. They would be a month in Lebanon and two months at home. [†](#n1_Kgs_CR189) Adoniram was in charge of the draft.

**15**  Solomon also [†](#n1_Kgs_CR190) had 70,000 burden-bearers and 80,000 stonecutters in the hill country,

**16**  besides Solomon’s 3,300 [†](#n1_Kgs_CR191) chief officers who were over the work, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR192) who had charge of the people who carried on the work.

**17** [✞] At the king’s command [†](#n1_Kgs_CR193) they quarried out great, costly stones in order to lay the foundation of the house with dressed stones.

**18** [✞] So Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR194) the men of Gebal did the cutting and prepared the timber and the stone to build the house.6 [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR195) In the four hundred and eightieth year after the people of Israel came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, which is the second month, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR196) he began to build the house of the L**ORD**.

**2** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR197) The house that King Solomon built for the L**ORD** was sixty cubits [*](#n1_Kgs_NC19) long, twenty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high.

**3**  The vestibule in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits long, equal to the width of the house, and ten cubits deep in front of the house.

**4** [✞] And [†](#n1_Kgs_CR198) he made for the house windows with recessed frames. [*](#n1_Kgs_NC20)

**5** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR199) He also built a structure [*](#n1_Kgs_NC21) against the wall of the house, running around the walls of the house, both the nave and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR200) the inner sanctuary. And he made [†](#n1_Kgs_CR201) side chambers all around.

**6** [✞] The lowest story [*](#n1_Kgs_NC22) was five cubits broad, the middle one was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad. For around the outside of the house he made offsets on the wall in order that the supporting beams should not be inserted into the walls of the house.

**7**  When the house was built, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR202) it was with stone prepared at the quarry, so that neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron was heard in the house while it was being built.

**8** [✞] The entrance for the lowest [*](#n1_Kgs_NC23) story was on the south side of the house, and one went up by stairs to the middle story, and from the middle story to the third.

**9**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR203) So he built the house and finished it, and he made the ceiling of the house of beams and planks of cedar.

**10**  He built the structure against the whole house, five cubits high, and it was joined to the house with timbers of cedar.

**11**  Now the word of the L**ORD** came to Solomon,

**12** [✞] “Concerning this house that you are building, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR204) if you will walk in my statutes and obey my rules and keep all my commandments and walk in them, then I will establish my word with you, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR205) which I spoke to David your father.

**13** [✞] And [†](#n1_Kgs_CR206) I will dwell among the children of Israel [†](#n1_Kgs_CR207) and will not forsake my people Israel.”

**14**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR208) So Solomon built the house and finished it.

**15**  He lined the walls of the house on the inside with boards of cedar. From the floor of the house to the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR209) and he covered the floor of the house with boards of cypress.

**16** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR210) He built twenty cubits of the rear of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the walls, and he built this within as an inner sanctuary, as [†](#n1_Kgs_CR211) the Most Holy Place.

**17**  The house, that is, the nave in front of the inner sanctuary, was forty cubits long.

**18**  The cedar within the house was carved in the form of [†](#n1_Kgs_CR212) gourds and open flowers. All was cedar; no stone was seen.

**19** [✞] The inner sanctuary he prepared in the innermost part of the house, to set there the ark of the covenant of the L**ORD**.

**20** [✞] The inner sanctuary [*](#n1_Kgs_NC24) was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high, and he overlaid it with pure gold. He also overlaid [*](#n1_Kgs_NC25) an altar of cedar.

**21**  And Solomon overlaid the inside of the house with pure gold, and he drew chains of gold across, in front of the inner sanctuary, and overlaid it with gold.

**22** [✞] And he overlaid the whole house with gold, until all the house was finished. [†](#n1_Kgs_CR213) Also the whole altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary he overlaid with gold.

**23** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR214) In the inner sanctuary [†](#n1_Kgs_CR215) he made two cherubim of olivewood, each ten cubits high.

**24**  Five cubits was the length of one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the length of the other wing of the cherub; it was ten cubits from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other.

**25**  The other cherub also measured ten cubits; both cherubim had the same measure and the same form.

**26**  The height of one cherub was ten cubits, and so was that of the other cherub.

**27**  He put the cherubim in the innermost part of the house. [†](#n1_Kgs_CR216) And the wings of the cherubim were spread out so that a wing of one touched the one wall, and a wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; their other wings touched each other in the middle of the house.

**28**  And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.

**29** [✞] Around all the walls of the house he carved engraved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, in the inner and outer rooms.

**30**  The floor of the house he overlaid with gold in the inner and outer rooms.

**31**  For the entrance to the inner sanctuary he made doors of olivewood; the lintel and the doorposts were five-sided. [*](#n1_Kgs_NC26)

**32**  He covered the two doors of olivewood with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers. He overlaid them with gold and spread gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees.

**33**  So also he made for the entrance to the nave doorposts of olivewood, in the form of a square,

**34**  and two doors of cypress wood. [†](#n1_Kgs_CR217) The two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.

**35**  On them he carved cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and he overlaid them with gold evenly applied on the carved work.

**36** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR218) He built the inner court with three courses of cut stone and one course of cedar beams.

**37**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR219) In the fourth year the foundation of the house of the L**ORD** was laid, in the month of Ziv.

**38** [✞] And in the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished in all its parts, and according to all its specifications. He was seven years in building it.7 Solomon was [†](#n1_Kgs_CR220) building his own house thirteen years, and he finished his entire house.

**2** [✞] He built [†](#n1_Kgs_CR221) the House of the Forest of Lebanon. Its length was a hundred cubits [*](#n1_Kgs_NC27) and its breadth fifty cubits and its height thirty cubits, and it was built on four [*](#n1_Kgs_NC28) rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars.

**3**  And it was covered with cedar above the chambers that were on the forty-five pillars, fifteen in each row.

**4**  There were window frames in three rows, and window opposite window in three tiers.

**5**  All the doorways and windows [*](#n1_Kgs_NC29) had square frames, and window was opposite window in three tiers.

**6** [✞] And he made [†](#n1_Kgs_CR222) the Hall of Pillars; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth thirty cubits. There was a porch in front with pillars, and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR223) a canopy in front of them.

**7** [✞] And he made the Hall of the Throne where he was to pronounce judgment, even the Hall of Judgment. [†](#n1_Kgs_CR224) It was finished with cedar from floor to rafters. [*](#n1_Kgs_NC30)

**8**  His own house where he was to dwell, in the other court back of the hall, was of like workmanship. Solomon also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh’s daughter [†](#n1_Kgs_CR225) whom he had taken in marriage.

**9**  All these were made of costly stones, cut according to measure, sawed with saws, back and front, even from the foundation to the coping, and from the outside to the great court.

**10**  The foundation was of costly stones, huge stones, stones of eight and ten cubits.

**11**  And above were costly stones, cut according to measurement, and cedar.

**12**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR226) The great court had three courses of cut stone all around, and a course of cedar beams; so had the inner court of the house of the L**ORD** and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR227) the vestibule of the house.

**13** [✞] And King Solomon sent and brought [†](#n1_Kgs_CR228) Hiram from Tyre.

**14** [✞] He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in bronze. And [†](#n1_Kgs_CR229) he was full of wisdom, understanding, and skill for making any work in bronze. He came to King Solomon and did all his work.

**15** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR230) He cast [†](#n1_Kgs_CR231) two pillars of bronze. [†](#n1_Kgs_CR232) Eighteen cubits was the height of one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits measured its circumference. It was hollow, and its thickness was four fingers. The second pillar was the same. [*](#n1_Kgs_NC31)

**16** [✞] He also made two capitals of cast bronze to set on the tops of the pillars. The height of the one capital was five cubits, and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR233) the height of the other capital was five cubits.

**17**  There were lattices of checker work with wreaths of chain work for the capitals on the tops of the pillars, a lattice [*](#n1_Kgs_NC32) for the one capital and a lattice for the other capital.

**18**  Likewise he made pomegranates [*](#n1_Kgs_NC33) in two rows around the one latticework to cover the capital that was on the top of the pillar, and he did the same with the other capital.

**19**  Now the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars in the vestibule were of lily-work, four cubits.

**20**  The capitals were on the two pillars and also above the rounded projection which was beside the latticework. There were [†](#n1_Kgs_CR234) two hundred pomegranates in two rows all around, and so with the other capital.

**21**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR235) He set up the pillars at the vestibule of the temple. He set up the pillar on the south and called its name Jachin, and he set up the pillar on the north and called its name Boaz.

**22**  And on the tops of the pillars was lily-work. Thus the work of the pillars was finished.

**23** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR236) Then he made [†](#n1_Kgs_CR237) the sea of cast metal. It was round, ten cubits from brim to brim, and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference.

**24**  Under its brim were [†](#n1_Kgs_CR238) gourds, for ten cubits, compassing the sea all around. The gourds were in two rows, cast with it when it was cast.

**25** [✞] It stood on [†](#n1_Kgs_CR239) twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The sea was set on them, and all their rear parts were inward.

**26**  Its thickness was a handbreadth, [*](#n1_Kgs_NC34) and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It held two thousand baths. [*](#n1_Kgs_NC35)

**27** [✞] He also made the [†](#n1_Kgs_CR240) ten stands of bronze. Each stand was four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high.

**28**  This was the construction of the stands: they had panels, and the panels were set in the frames,

**29**  and on the panels that were set in the frames were lions, oxen, and cherubim. On the frames, both above and below the lions and oxen, there were wreaths of beveled work.

**30**  Moreover, each stand had four bronze wheels and axles of bronze, and at the four corners were supports for a basin. The supports were cast with wreaths at the side of each.

**31**  Its opening was within a crown that projected upward one cubit. Its opening was round, as a pedestal is made, a cubit and a half deep. At its opening there were carvings, and its panels were square, not round.

**32**  And the four wheels were underneath the panels. The axles of the wheels were of one piece with the stands, and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half.

**33**  The wheels were made like a chariot wheel; their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs were all cast.

**34**  There were four supports at the four corners of each stand. The supports were of one piece with the stands.

**35**  And on the top of the stand there was a round band half a cubit high; and on the top of the stand its stays and its panels were of one piece with it.

**36**  And on the surfaces of its stays and on its panels, he carved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths all around.

**37**  After this manner he made [†](#n1_Kgs_CR241) the ten stands. All of them were cast alike, of the same measure and the same form.

**38**  And he made [†](#n1_Kgs_CR242) ten basins of bronze. Each basin held forty baths, each basin measured four cubits, and there was a basin for each of the ten stands.

**39**  And he set the stands, five on the south side of the house, and five on the north side of the house. And he set the sea at the southeast corner of the house.

**40** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR243) Hiram also made [†](#n1_Kgs_CR244) the pots, the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram finished all the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of the L**ORD**:

**41**  the two pillars, the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars, and the two [†](#n1_Kgs_CR245) latticeworks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars;

**42**  and the [†](#n1_Kgs_CR246) four hundred pomegranates for the two latticeworks, two rows of pomegranates for each latticework, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars;

**43**  the ten stands, and the ten basins on the stands;

**44**  and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR247) the one sea, and the twelve oxen underneath the sea.

**45**  Now [†](#n1_Kgs_CR248) the pots, the shovels, and the basins, all these vessels in the house of the L**ORD**, which Hiram made for King Solomon, were of burnished bronze.

**46** [✞] In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between [†](#n1_Kgs_CR249) Succoth and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR250) Zarethan.

**47**  And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because there were so many of them; [†](#n1_Kgs_CR251) the weight of the bronze was not ascertained.

**48** [✞] So Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of the L**ORD**: [†](#n1_Kgs_CR252) the golden altar, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR253) the golden table for [†](#n1_Kgs_CR254) the bread of the Presence,

**49** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR255) the lampstands of pure gold, five on the south side and five on the north, before the inner sanctuary; [†](#n1_Kgs_CR256) the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;

**50**  the cups, snuffers, basins, dishes for incense, and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR257) fire pans, of pure gold; and the sockets of gold, for the doors of the innermost part of the house, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR258) the Most Holy Place, and for the doors of the nave of the temple.

**51** [✞] Thus all the work that King Solomon did on the house of the L**ORD** was finished. And Solomon brought in [†](#n1_Kgs_CR259) the things that David his father had dedicated, the silver, the gold, and the vessels, and stored them in the treasuries of the house of the L**ORD**.8 [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR260) Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR261) the leaders of the fathers’ houses of the people of Israel, before King Solomon in Jerusalem, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR262) to bring up the ark of the covenant of the L**ORD** out of [†](#n1_Kgs_CR263) the city of David, which is Zion.

**2** [✞] And all the men of Israel assembled to King Solomon at [†](#n1_Kgs_CR264) the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.

**3**  And all the elders of Israel came, and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR265) the priests took up the ark.

**4** [✞] And they brought up the ark of the L**ORD**, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR266) the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent; the priests and the Levites brought them up.

**5**  And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who had assembled before him, were with him before the ark, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR267) sacrificing so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered.

**6** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR268) Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the L**ORD** [†](#n1_Kgs_CR269) to its place in [†](#n1_Kgs_CR270) the inner sanctuary of the house, in the Most Holy Place, underneath the wings of the cherubim.

**7**  For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubim overshadowed the ark and its poles.

**8** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR271) And the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the Holy Place before [†](#n1_Kgs_CR272) the inner sanctuary; but they could not be seen from outside. And they are there to this day.

**9** [✞] There was nothing in the ark except [†](#n1_Kgs_CR273) the two tablets of stone that Moses put there at Horeb, where [†](#n1_Kgs_CR274) the L**ORD** made a covenant with the people of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.

**10** [✞] And when the priests came out of the Holy Place, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR275) a cloud filled the house of the L**ORD**,

**11**  so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the L**ORD** filled the house of the L**ORD**.

**12** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR276) Then Solomon said, “The L**ORD** [*](#n1_Kgs_NC36) has said that he would dwell [†](#n1_Kgs_CR277) in thick darkness.

**13** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR278) I have indeed built you an exalted house, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR279) a place for you to dwell in forever.”

**14**  Then the king turned around and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR280) blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel stood.

**15**  And he said, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR281) “Blessed be the L**ORD**, the God of Israel, who with his hand has fulfilled [†](#n1_Kgs_CR282) what he promised with his mouth to David my father, saying,

**16**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR283) ‘Since the day that I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR284) that my name might be there. [†](#n1_Kgs_CR285) But I chose David to be over my people Israel.’

**17**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR286) Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the L**ORD**, the God of Israel.

**18**  But the L**ORD** said to David my father, ‘Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart.

**19**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR287) Nevertheless, you shall not build the house, but your son who shall be born to you shall build the house for my name.’

**20**  Now the L**ORD** has fulfilled his promise that he made. For I have risen in the place of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR288) as the L**ORD** promised, and I have built the house for the name of the L**ORD**, the God of Israel.

**21**  And there I have provided a place for the ark, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR289) in which is the covenant of the L**ORD** that he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.”

**22** [✞] Then Solomon [†](#n1_Kgs_CR290) stood before the altar of the L**ORD** in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR291) spread out his hands toward heaven,

**23** [✞] and said, “O L**ORD**, God of Israel, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR292) there is no God like you, in heaven above or on earth beneath, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR293) keeping covenant and showing steadfast love to your servants who walk before you with all their heart;

**24**  you have kept with your servant David my father what you declared to him. [†](#n1_Kgs_CR294) You spoke with your mouth, and with your hand have fulfilled it this day.

**25** [✞] Now therefore, O L**ORD**, God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father what you have promised him, saying, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR295) ‘You shall not lack a man to sit before me on the throne of Israel, if only your sons pay close attention to their way, to walk before me as you have walked before me.’

**26**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR296) Now therefore, O God of Israel, let your word be confirmed, which you have spoken to your servant David my father.

**27**  “But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR297) heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain you; how much less this house that I have built!

**28**  Yet have regard to the prayer of your servant and to his plea, O L**ORD** my God, listening to the cry and to the prayer that your servant prays before you this day,

**29** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR298) that your eyes may be open night and day toward this house, the place of which you have said, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR299) ‘My name shall be there,’ that you may listen to the prayer that your servant offers toward this place.

**30**  And listen to the plea of your servant and of your people Israel, when they pray toward this place. And listen in heaven your dwelling place, and when you hear, forgive.

**31** [✞] “If a man sins against his neighbor and is made to take [†](#n1_Kgs_CR300) an oath and comes and swears his oath before your altar in this house,

**32**  then hear in heaven and act and judge your servants, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR301) condemning the guilty by bringing his conduct on his own head, and vindicating the righteous by rewarding him according to his righteousness.

**33** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR302) “When your people Israel are defeated before the enemy because they have sinned against you, and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR303) if they turn again to you and acknowledge your name and pray and plead with you in this house,

**34** [✞] then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them again to the land that you gave to their fathers.

**35** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR304) “When heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against you, if they pray toward this place and acknowledge your name and turn from their sin, when you afflict them,

**36**  then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel, when [†](#n1_Kgs_CR305) you teach them [†](#n1_Kgs_CR306) the good way in which they should walk, and grant rain upon your land, which you have given to your people as an inheritance.

**37** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR307) “If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence or blight or mildew or locust or caterpillar, if their enemy besieges them in the land at their gates, [*](#n1_Kgs_NC37) whatever plague, whatever sickness there is,

**38**  whatever prayer, whatever plea is made by any man or by all your people Israel, each knowing the affliction of his own heart and stretching out his hands toward this house,

**39** [✞] then hear in heaven your dwelling place and forgive and act and render to each whose heart you know, according to all his ways ([†](#n1_Kgs_CR308) for you, you only, know the hearts of all the children of mankind),

**40**  that they may fear you [†](#n1_Kgs_CR309) all the days that they live in the land that you gave to our fathers.

**41**  “Likewise, when a foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, comes from a far country for your name’s sake

**42**  (for they shall hear of your great name [†](#n1_Kgs_CR310) and your mighty hand, and of your outstretched arm), when he comes and prays toward this house,

**43** [✞] hear in heaven your dwelling place and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to you, in order [†](#n1_Kgs_CR311) that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR312) fear you, as do your people Israel, and that they may know that this house that I have built is called by your name.

**44** [✞] “If your people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatever way you shall send them, and they pray to the L**ORD** [†](#n1_Kgs_CR313) toward the city that you have chosen and the house that I have built for your name,

**45**  then hear in heaven their prayer and their plea, and maintain their cause.

**46** [✞] “If they sin against you—[†](#n1_Kgs_CR314) for there is no one who does not sin—and you are angry with them and give them to an enemy, so that they are carried away captive [†](#n1_Kgs_CR315) to the land of the enemy, far off or near,

**47**  yet [†](#n1_Kgs_CR316) if they turn their heart in the land to which they have been carried captive, and repent and plead with you in the land of their captors, saying, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR317) ‘We have sinned and have acted perversely and wickedly,’

**48**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR318) if they repent with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies, who carried them captive, and pray to you [†](#n1_Kgs_CR319) toward their land, which you gave to their fathers, the city that you have chosen, and the house that I have built for your name,

**49**  then hear in heaven your dwelling place their prayer and their plea, and maintain their cause

**50** [✞] and forgive your people who have sinned against you, and all their transgressions that they have committed against you, and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR320) grant them compassion in the sight of those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them

**51**  ([†](#n1_Kgs_CR321) for they are your people, and your heritage, which you brought out of Egypt, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR322) from the midst of the iron furnace).

**52**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR323) Let your eyes be open to the plea of your servant and to the plea of your people Israel, giving ear to them whenever they call to you.

**53** [✞] For you separated them from among all the peoples of the earth to be your heritage, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR324) as you declared through Moses your servant, when you brought our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord **GOD**.”

**54**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR325) Now as Solomon finished offering all this prayer and plea to the L**ORD**, he arose from before the altar of the L**ORD**, where he had [†](#n1_Kgs_CR326) knelt with hands outstretched toward heaven.

**55**  And he stood and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR327) blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying,

**56** [✞] “Blessed be the L**ORD** who has given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he promised. [†](#n1_Kgs_CR328) Not one word has failed of all his good promise, which he spoke by Moses his servant.

**57**  The L**ORD** our God be with us, as he was with our fathers. [†](#n1_Kgs_CR329) May he not leave us or forsake us,

**58**  that he may [†](#n1_Kgs_CR330) incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments, his statutes, and his rules, which he commanded our fathers.

**59**  Let these words of mine, with which I have pleaded before the L**ORD**, be near to the L**ORD** our God day and night, and may he maintain the cause of his servant and the cause of his people Israel, as each day requires,

**60** [✞] that [†](#n1_Kgs_CR331) all the peoples of the earth may know that [†](#n1_Kgs_CR332) the L**ORD** is God; there is no other.

**61**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR333) Let your heart therefore be wholly true to the L**ORD** our God, walking in his statutes and keeping his commandments, as at this day.”

**62**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR334) Then [†](#n1_Kgs_CR335) the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the L**ORD**.

**63** [✞] Solomon offered as peace offerings to the L**ORD** 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. So the king and all the people of Israel dedicated the house of the L**ORD**.

**64** [✞] The same day the king consecrated the middle of the court that was before the house of the L**ORD**, for there he offered the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat pieces of the peace offerings, because [†](#n1_Kgs_CR336) the bronze altar that was before the L**ORD** was too small to receive the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat pieces of the peace offerings.

**65** [✞] So Solomon held [†](#n1_Kgs_CR337) the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from [†](#n1_Kgs_CR338) Lebo-hamath to [†](#n1_Kgs_CR339) the Brook of Egypt, before the L**ORD** our God, seven days. [*](#n1_Kgs_NC38)

**66** [✞] On the eighth day he sent the people away, and they blessed the king and went to their homes joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the L**ORD** had shown to David his servant and to Israel his people.9 [†](#n1_Kgs_CR340) As soon as Solomon had finished building the house of the L**ORD** [†](#n1_Kgs_CR341) and the king’s house and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR342) all that Solomon desired to build,

**2** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR343) the L**ORD** appeared to Solomon a second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.

**3** [✞] And the L**ORD** said to him, “I have heard your prayer and your plea, which you have made before me. I have consecrated this house that you have built, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR344) by putting my name there forever. [†](#n1_Kgs_CR345) My eyes and my heart will be there for all time.

**4** [✞] And as for you, if you will [†](#n1_Kgs_CR346) walk before me, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR347) as David your father walked, with integrity of heart and uprightness, doing according to all that I have commanded you, and keeping my statutes and my rules,

**5**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR348) then I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised David your father, saying, ‘You shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.’

**6**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR349) But if you turn aside from following me, you or your children, and do not keep my commandments and my statutes that I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and worship them,

**7** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR350) then I will cut off Israel from the land that I have given them, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR351) and the house that I have consecrated for my name I will cast out of my sight, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR352) and Israel will become a proverb and a byword among all peoples.

**8**  And this house will become a heap of ruins. [*](#n1_Kgs_NC39) Everyone passing by it will be astonished and will hiss, and they will say, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR353) ‘Why has the L**ORD** done thus to this land and to this house?’

**9** [✞] Then they will say, ‘Because [†](#n1_Kgs_CR354) they abandoned the L**ORD** their God who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt and laid hold on other gods and worshiped them and served them. Therefore the L**ORD** has brought all this disaster on them.’”

**10** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR355) At the end of [†](#n1_Kgs_CR356) twenty years, in which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the L**ORD** and the king’s house,

**11** [✞] and Hiram king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress timber and gold, as much as he desired, King Solomon gave to Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.

**12**  But when Hiram came from Tyre to see the cities that Solomon had given him, they did not please him.

**13** [✞] Therefore he said, “What kind of cities are these that you have given me, my brother?” So they are called the land of [†](#n1_Kgs_CR357) Cabul to this day.

**14** [✞] Hiram had sent to the king 120 talents [*](#n1_Kgs_NC40) of gold.

**15** [✞] And this is the account of [†](#n1_Kgs_CR358) the forced labor that King Solomon drafted to build the house of the L**ORD** and his own house and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR359) the Millo and the wall of Jerusalem and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR360) Hazor and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR361) Megiddo and Gezer

**16** [✞] (Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and captured Gezer and burned it with fire, and had killed [†](#n1_Kgs_CR362) the Canaanites who lived in the city, and had given it as dowry to [†](#n1_Kgs_CR363) his daughter, Solomon’s wife;

**17** [✞] so Solomon rebuilt Gezer) and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR364) Lower Beth-horon

**18** [✞] and Baalath and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land of Judah, [*](#n1_Kgs_NC41)

**19**  and all the store cities that Solomon had, and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR365) the cities for his chariots, and the cities for [†](#n1_Kgs_CR366) his horsemen, and whatever Solomon [†](#n1_Kgs_CR367) desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.

**20** [✞] All the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the people of Israel—

**21**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR368) their descendants who were left after them in the land, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR369) whom the people of Israel were unable to devote to destruction [*](#n1_Kgs_NC42)—[†](#n1_Kgs_CR370) these Solomon drafted to be [†](#n1_Kgs_CR371) slaves, and so they are to this day.

**22** [✞] But [†](#n1_Kgs_CR372) of the people of Israel Solomon made no slaves. They were the soldiers, they were his officials, his commanders, his captains, his chariot commanders and his horsemen.

**23**  These were the chief officers who were over Solomon’s work: [†](#n1_Kgs_CR373) 550 [†](#n1_Kgs_CR374) who had charge of the people who carried on the work.

**24**  But [†](#n1_Kgs_CR375) Pharaoh’s daughter went up from the city of David to [†](#n1_Kgs_CR376) her own house that Solomon had built for her. [†](#n1_Kgs_CR377) Then he built [†](#n1_Kgs_CR378) the Millo.

**25**  Three times a year Solomon used to offer up burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar that he built to the L**ORD**, making offerings with it [*](#n1_Kgs_NC43) before the L**ORD**. So he finished the house.

**26** [✞] King Solomon built a fleet of ships at [†](#n1_Kgs_CR379) Ezion-geber, which is near Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.

**27**  And Hiram sent [†](#n1_Kgs_CR380) with the fleet his servants, seamen who were familiar with the sea, together with the servants of Solomon.

**28** [✞] And they went to [†](#n1_Kgs_CR381) Ophir and brought from there gold, 420 talents, and they brought it to King Solomon.10 [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR382) Now when [†](#n1_Kgs_CR383) the queen of [†](#n1_Kgs_CR384) Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the L**ORD**, she came [†](#n1_Kgs_CR385) to test him with hard questions.

**2**  She came to Jerusalem with a very great retinue, with camels [†](#n1_Kgs_CR386) bearing spices and very much gold and precious stones. And when she came to Solomon, she told him all that was on her mind.

**3**  And Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing hidden from the king that he could not explain to her.

**4**  And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built,

**5** [✞] the food of his table, the seating of his officials, and the attendance of his servants, their clothing, his cupbearers, and his burnt offerings that he offered at the house of the L**ORD**, there was no more breath in her.

**6**  And she said to the king, “The report was true that I heard in my own land of your words and of your wisdom,

**7**  but I did not believe the reports until I came and my own eyes had seen it. And behold, the half was not told me. Your wisdom and prosperity surpass the report that I heard.

**8**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR387) Happy are your men! Happy are your servants, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom!

**9** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR388) Blessed be the L**ORD** your God, who has delighted in you and set you on the throne of Israel! [†](#n1_Kgs_CR389) Because the L**ORD** loved Israel forever, he has made you king, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR390) that you may execute justice and righteousness.”

**10**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR391) Then she gave the king 120 talents [*](#n1_Kgs_NC44) of gold, and a very great quantity of spices and precious stones. Never again came such an abundance of spices as these that the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.

**11** [✞] Moreover, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR392) the fleet of Hiram, which brought [†](#n1_Kgs_CR393) gold from Ophir, brought from Ophir a very great amount of almug wood and precious stones.

**12** [✞] And the king made of the almug wood supports for the house of the L**ORD** and for the king’s house, also lyres and harps for the singers. No such almug wood has come or been seen to this day.

**13** [✞] And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all that she desired, whatever she asked besides what was given her by the bounty of King Solomon. So she turned and went back to her own land with her servants.

**14** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR394) Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was 666 talents of gold,

**15** [✞] besides that which came from the explorers and from the business of the merchants, and from all the kings of the west and from the governors of the land.

**16** [✞] King Solomon made 200 large shields of beaten gold; 600 shekels [*](#n1_Kgs_NC45) of gold went into each shield.

**17** [✞] And he made 300 [†](#n1_Kgs_CR395) shields of beaten gold; three minas [*](#n1_Kgs_NC46) of gold went into each shield. And the king put them in [†](#n1_Kgs_CR396) the House of the Forest of Lebanon.

**18** [✞] The king also made a great ivory throne and overlaid it with the finest gold.

**19**  The throne had six steps, and the throne had a round top, [*](#n1_Kgs_NC47) and on each side of the seat were armrests and two lions standing beside the armrests,

**20**  while twelve lions stood there, one on each end of a step on the six steps. The like of it was never made in any kingdom.

**21** [✞] All King Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of [†](#n1_Kgs_CR397) the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. None were of silver; silver was not considered as anything in the days of Solomon.

**22** [✞] For the king had [†](#n1_Kgs_CR398) a fleet of ships of Tarshish at sea with the fleet of Hiram. Once every three years the fleet of ships of Tarshish used to come bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks. [*](#n1_Kgs_NC48)

**23**  [†](#n1_Kgs_CR399) Thus King Solomon excelled all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.

**24**  And the whole earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put into his mind.

**25**  Every one of them brought his present, articles of silver and gold, garments, myrrh, [*](#n1_Kgs_NC48a) spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year.

**26** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR400) And Solomon gathered together [†](#n1_Kgs_CR401) chariots and horsemen. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen, whom he stationed in the [†](#n1_Kgs_CR402) chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.

**27**  And the king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stone, and he made cedar as plentiful as [†](#n1_Kgs_CR403) the sycamore of the Shephelah.

**28** [✞] And Solomon’s [†](#n1_Kgs_CR404) import of horses was from Egypt and Kue, and the king’s traders received them from Kue at a price.

**29** [✞] A chariot could be imported from Egypt for 600 shekels of silver and a horse for 150, and so through the king’s traders they were exported to all the kings of [†](#n1_Kgs_CR405) the Hittites and the kings of Syria.11 [✞] Now [†](#n1_Kgs_CR406) King Solomon loved many foreign women, along with the daughter of Pharaoh: Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite women,

**2** [✞] from the nations concerning which the L**ORD** had said to the people of Israel, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR407) “You shall not enter into marriage with them, neither shall they with you, for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods.” Solomon clung to these in love.

**3**  He had 700 wives, who were princesses, and 300 concubines. And his wives turned away his heart.

**4** [✞] For when Solomon was old his wives turned away his heart after other gods, and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR408) his heart was not wholly true to the L**ORD** his God, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR409) as was the heart of David his father.

**5** [✞] For Solomon went after [†](#n1_Kgs_CR410) Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after [†](#n1_Kgs_CR411) Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.

**6** [✞] So Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the L**ORD** and did not wholly follow the L**ORD**, as David his father had done.

**7** [✞] Then Solomon built a high place for [†](#n1_Kgs_CR412) Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for [†](#n1_Kgs_CR413) Molech the abomination of the Ammonites, on the mountain east of Jerusalem.

**8**  And so he did for all his foreign wives, who made offerings and sacrificed to their gods.

**9**  And the L**ORD** was angry with Solomon, because [†](#n1_Kgs_CR414) his heart had turned away from the L**ORD**, the God of Israel, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR415) who had appeared to him twice

**10** [✞] and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR416) had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods. But he did not keep what the L**ORD** commanded.

**11** [✞] Therefore the L**ORD** said to Solomon, “Since this has been your practice and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes that I have commanded you, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR417) I will surely tear the kingdom from you and will give it to your servant.

**12** [✞] Yet for the sake of David your father I will not do it in your days, but I will tear it out of the hand of your son.

**13** [✞] However, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR418) I will not tear away all the kingdom, but [†](#n1_Kgs_CR419) I will give one tribe to your son, for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem [†](#n1_Kgs_CR420) that I have chosen.”

**14**  And the L**ORD** raised up an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite. He was of the royal house in Edom.

**15** [✞] For [†](#n1_Kgs_CR421) when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army went up to bury the slain, he struck down every male in Edom

**16**  (for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom).

**17**  But Hadad fled to Egypt, together with certain Edomites of his father’s servants, Hadad still being a little child.

**18** [✞] They set out from Midian and came to [†](#n1_Kgs_CR422) Paran and took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house and assigned him an allowance of food and gave him land.

**19**  And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him in marriage the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.

**20**  And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house. And Genubath was in Pharaoh’s house among the sons of Pharaoh.

**21**  But when Hadad heard in Egypt [†](#n1_Kgs_CR423) that David slept with his fathers and that Joab the commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, “Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.”

**22** [✞] But Pharaoh said to him, “What have you lacked with me that you are now seeking to go to your own country?” And he said to him, “Only let me depart.”

**23** [✞] God also raised up as an adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his master [†](#n1_Kgs_CR424) Hadadezer king of Zobah.

**24** [✞] And he gathered men about him and became leader of a marauding band, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR425) after the killing by David. And they went to Damascus and lived there and made him king in Damascus.

**25**  He was an adversary of Israel all the days of Solomon, doing harm as Hadad did. And he loathed Israel and reigned over Syria.

**26** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR426) Jeroboam the son of Nebat, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR427) an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow, also [†](#n1_Kgs_CR428) lifted up his hand against the king.

**27** [✞] And this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king. [†](#n1_Kgs_CR429) Solomon built the Millo, and closed up the breach of the city of David his father.

**28** [✞] The man Jeroboam was very able, and when Solomon saw that the young man was industrious he gave him charge over all the forced labor of the house of Joseph.

**29** [✞] And at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, the prophet [†](#n1_Kgs_CR430) Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the road. Now Ahijah had dressed himself in a new garment, and the two of them were alone in the open country.

**30** [✞] Then Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR431) and tore it into twelve pieces.

**31** [✞] And he said to Jeroboam, “Take for yourself ten pieces, for thus says the L**ORD**, the God of Israel, ‘Behold, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR432) I am about to tear the kingdom from the hand of Solomon and will give you ten tribes

**32** [✞] (but [†](#n1_Kgs_CR433) he shall have one tribe, for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR434) the city that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel),

**33**  because they have [*](#n1_Kgs_NC49) forsaken me [†](#n1_Kgs_CR435) and worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites, and they have not walked in my ways, doing what is right in my sight and keeping my statutes and my rules, as David his father did.

**34** [✞] Nevertheless, I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him ruler all the days of his life, for the sake of David my servant whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes.

**35** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR436) But I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand and will give it to you, ten tribes.

**36** [✞] Yet to his son [†](#n1_Kgs_CR437) I will give one tribe, that David my servant may always have [†](#n1_Kgs_CR438) a lamp before me in Jerusalem, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR439) the city where I have chosen to put my name.

**37** [✞] And I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your soul desires, and you shall be king over Israel.

**38** [✞] And if you will listen to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do what is right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did, [†](#n1_Kgs_CR440) I will be with you and [†](#n1_Kgs_CR441) will build you a sure house, as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you.

**39** [✞] And I will afflict the offspring of David because of this, but not forever.’”

**40** [✞] Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam arose and fled into Egypt, to [†](#n1_Kgs_CR442) Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.

**41** [✞] [†](#n1_Kgs_CR443) Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon?

**42** [✞] And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.

**43** [✞] And Solomon [†](#n1_Kgs_CR444) slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David his father. And [†](#n1_Kgs_CR445) Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.
