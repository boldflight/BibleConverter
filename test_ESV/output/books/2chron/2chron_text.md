### Solomon Worships at Gibeon

1 [✞][†](#n2_Chr_CR1) Solomon the son of David established himself in his kingdom, [†](#n2_Chr_CR2) and the L**ORD** his God was with him and made him exceedingly great.

**2** [✞] Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the [†](#n2_Chr_CR3) commanders of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to all the leaders in all Israel, the heads of fathers’ houses.

**3**  And Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to [†](#n2_Chr_CR4) the high place that was at Gibeon, [†](#n2_Chr_CR5) for [†](#n2_Chr_CR6) the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of the L**ORD** had made in the wilderness, was there.

**4**  [†](#n2_Chr_CR7) (But David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the place that David had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.)

**5** [✞] Moreover, [†](#n2_Chr_CR8) the bronze altar that [†](#n2_Chr_CR9) Bezalel the son of Uri, son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of the L**ORD**. And Solomon and the assembly [†](#n2_Chr_CR10) sought it [*](#n2_Chr_NC1) out.

**6**  And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the L**ORD**, which was at the tent of meeting, [†](#n2_Chr_CR11) and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.

**7** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR12) In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, “Ask what I shall give you.”

**8**  And Solomon said to God, “You have shown great and steadfast love to David my father, [†](#n2_Chr_CR13) and have made me king in his place.

**9** [✞] O L**ORD** God, [†](#n2_Chr_CR14) let your word to David my father be now fulfilled, for you have made me king over a people as numerous [†](#n2_Chr_CR15) as the dust of the earth.

**10** [✞] Give me now wisdom and knowledge to [†](#n2_Chr_CR16) go out and come in before this people, for who can govern this people of yours, which is so great?”

**11**  God answered Solomon, “Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked for [†](#n2_Chr_CR17) possessions, wealth, honor, or the life of those who hate you, and have not even asked for long life, but have asked for wisdom and knowledge for yourself that you may govern my people over whom I have made you king,

**12**  wisdom and knowledge are granted to you. I will also give you [†](#n2_Chr_CR18) riches, possessions, and honor, [†](#n2_Chr_CR19) such as none of the kings had who were before you, and none after you shall have the like.”

**13** [✞] So Solomon came from [*](#n2_Chr_NC2) the [†](#n2_Chr_CR20) high place at Gibeon, from before [†](#n2_Chr_CR21) the tent of meeting, to Jerusalem. And he reigned over Israel.

**14** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR22) Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen. [†](#n2_Chr_CR23) He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen, whom he stationed [†](#n2_Chr_CR24) in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.

**15**  And the king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stone, and he made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephelah.

**16**  And Solomon’s import of horses was from Egypt and Kue, and the king’s traders would buy them from Kue for a price.

**17**  They imported a chariot from Egypt for 600 shekels [*](#n2_Chr_NC3) of silver, and a horse for 150. Likewise through them these were exported to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.2 [✞] [*](#n2_Chr_NC4) [†](#n2_Chr_CR25) Now Solomon purposed to build a temple for the name of the L**ORD**, and a royal palace for himself.

**2** [✞] [*](#n2_Chr_NC5) [†](#n2_Chr_CR26) And Solomon assigned 70,000 men to bear burdens and 80,000 to quarry in the hill country, and [†](#n2_Chr_CR27) 3,600 to oversee them.

**3** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR28) And Solomon sent word to Hiram the king of Tyre: [†](#n2_Chr_CR29) “As you dealt with David my father and sent him cedar to build himself a house to dwell in, so deal with me.

**4** [✞] Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of the L**ORD** my God and dedicate it to him for the burning of [†](#n2_Chr_CR30) incense of sweet spices before him, and for [†](#n2_Chr_CR31) the regular arrangement of the showbread, and for [†](#n2_Chr_CR32) burnt offerings morning and evening, [†](#n2_Chr_CR33) on the Sabbaths and the new moons and the appointed feasts of the L**ORD** our God, as ordained forever for Israel.

**5**  The house that I am to build will be great, [†](#n2_Chr_CR34) for our God is greater than all gods.

**6** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR35) But who is able to build him a house, since [†](#n2_Chr_CR35) heaven, even highest heaven, cannot contain him? Who am I to build a house for him, except as a place to make offerings before him?

**7**  So now [†](#n2_Chr_CR36) send me a man skilled to work in gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and in purple, crimson, and blue fabrics, trained also in engraving, to be with the skilled workers who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem, [†](#n2_Chr_CR37) whom David my father provided.

**8**  Send me also cedar, cypress, and algum timber from Lebanon, for I know that [†](#n2_Chr_CR38) your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon. And my servants will be with your servants,

**9**  to prepare timber for me in abundance, for the house I am to build will be great and wonderful.

**10** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR39) I will give for your servants, the woodsmen who cut timber, 20,000 cors [*](#n2_Chr_NC6) of crushed wheat, 20,000 cors of barley, 20,000 baths [*](#n2_Chr_NC7) of wine, and 20,000 baths of oil.”

**11** [✞] Then Hiram the king of Tyre answered in a letter that he sent to Solomon, [†](#n2_Chr_CR40) “Because the L**ORD** loves his people, he has made you king over them.”

**12** [✞] Hiram also said, “Blessed be the L**ORD** God of Israel, [†](#n2_Chr_CR41) who made heaven and earth, who has given King David a wise son, who has discretion and understanding, [†](#n2_Chr_CR42) who will build a temple for the L**ORD** and a royal palace for himself.

**13**  “Now I have sent a skilled man, who has understanding, Huram-abi,

**14** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR43) the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre. He is [†](#n2_Chr_CR44) trained to work in gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, and in purple, blue, and crimson fabrics and fine linen, and to do all sorts of engraving and execute any design that may be assigned him, with your craftsmen, the craftsmen of my lord, David your father.

**15**  Now therefore the wheat and barley, oil and wine, [†](#n2_Chr_CR45) of which my lord has spoken, let him send to his servants.

**16**  [†](#n2_Chr_CR46) And we will cut whatever timber you need from Lebanon and bring it to you in rafts by sea to [†](#n2_Chr_CR47) Joppa, so that you may take it up to Jerusalem.”

**17** [✞] Then Solomon counted all the resident aliens who were in the land of Israel, [†](#n2_Chr_CR48) after the census of them that David his father had taken, and there were found 153,600.

**18** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR49) Seventy thousand of them he assigned to bear burdens, 80,000 to quarry in the hill country, and 3,600 as overseers to make the people work.3 [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR50) Then Solomon began to build the house of the L**ORD** in Jerusalem [†](#n2_Chr_CR51) on Mount Moriah, where the L**ORD** [*](#n2_Chr_NC8) had appeared to David his father, at the place that David had appointed, [†](#n2_Chr_CR52) on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

**2** [✞] He began to build in the second month of the fourth year of his reign.

**3** [✞] These are Solomon’s [†](#n2_Chr_CR53) measurements [*](#n2_Chr_NC9) for building the house of God: [†](#n2_Chr_CR54) the length, in cubits [*](#n2_Chr_NC10) of the old standard, was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.

**4** [✞] The vestibule in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits long, equal to the width of the house, [*](#n2_Chr_NC11) and its height was 120 cubits. He overlaid it on the inside with pure gold.

**5** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR55) The nave he lined with cypress and covered it with fine gold [†](#n2_Chr_CR56) and made palms and chains on it.

**6** [✞] He adorned the house with settings of precious stones. The gold was gold of Parvaim.

**7**  So he lined the house with gold—its beams, its thresholds, its walls, and its doors—[†](#n2_Chr_CR57) and he carved cherubim on the walls.

**8**  [†](#n2_Chr_CR58) And he made the Most Holy Place. Its length, corresponding to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and its breadth was twenty cubits. He overlaid it with 600 talents [*](#n2_Chr_NC12) of fine gold.

**9** [✞] The weight of gold for the nails was fifty shekels. [*](#n2_Chr_NC13) And he overlaid [†](#n2_Chr_CR59) the upper chambers with gold.

**10** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR60) In the Most Holy Place he made two cherubim of wood [*](#n2_Chr_NC14) and overlaid [*](#n2_Chr_NC15) them with gold.

**11**  The wings of the cherubim together extended twenty cubits: one wing of the one, of five cubits, touched the wall of the house, and its other wing, of five cubits, touched the wing of the other cherub;

**12**  and of this cherub, one wing, of five cubits, touched the wall of the house, and the other wing, also of five cubits, was joined to the wing of the first cherub.

**13**  The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits. The cherubim [*](#n2_Chr_NC16) stood on their feet, [†](#n2_Chr_CR61) facing the nave.

**14** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR62) And he made the veil of blue and purple and crimson fabrics and fine linen, and he worked cherubim on it.

**15** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR63) In front of the house he made two pillars thirty-five cubits high, with a capital of five cubits on the top of each.

**16** [✞] He made chains like a necklace [*](#n2_Chr_NC17) and put them on the tops of the pillars, and he made a hundred pomegranates and put them on the chains.

**17** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR64) He set up the pillars in front of the temple, one on the south, the other on the north; that on the south he called Jachin, and that on the north Boaz.4 [✞] He made [†](#n2_Chr_CR65) an altar of bronze, twenty cubits [*](#n2_Chr_NC18) long and twenty cubits wide and ten cubits high.

**2** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR66) Then he made the sea of cast metal. It was round, ten cubits from brim to brim, and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference.

**3** [✞] Under it were figures of gourds, [*](#n2_Chr_NC19) for ten cubits, compassing the sea all around. The gourds were in two rows, cast with it when it was cast.

**4** [✞] It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The sea was set on them, and all their rear parts were inward.

**5** [✞] Its thickness was a handbreadth. [*](#n2_Chr_NC20) And its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. [†](#n2_Chr_CR67) It held 3,000 baths. [*](#n2_Chr_NC21)

**6**  [†](#n2_Chr_CR68) He also made ten basins in which to wash, and set five on the south side, and five on the north side. In these they were to rinse off what was used for the burnt offering, and the sea was for the priests to wash in.

**7** [✞] And he made ten golden lampstands [†](#n2_Chr_CR69) as prescribed, and set them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north.

**8** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR70) He also made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north. And he made a hundred basins of gold.

**9** [✞] He made [†](#n2_Chr_CR71) the court of the priests [†](#n2_Chr_CR72) and the great court and doors for the court and overlaid their doors with bronze.

**10**  [†](#n2_Chr_CR73) And he set the sea at the southeast corner of the house.

**11** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR74) [†]() [†](#n2_Chr_CR75) Hiram also made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. [†](#n2_Chr_CR75) So Hiram finished the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of God:

**12**  the two pillars, [†](#n2_Chr_CR76) the bowls, and the two capitals on the top of the pillars; and the two latticeworks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;

**13**  [†](#n2_Chr_CR77) and the 400 pomegranates for the two latticeworks, two rows of pomegranates for each latticework, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars.

**14**  [†](#n2_Chr_CR78) He made the stands also, and the basins on the stands,

**15**  and the one sea, and the twelve oxen underneath it.

**16**  The pots, the shovels, [†](#n2_Chr_CR79) the forks, and all the equipment for these [†](#n2_Chr_CR80) [†]() [†](#n2_Chr_CR81) Huram-abi made of burnished bronze for King Solomon for the house of the L**ORD**.

**17**  In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah. [*](#n2_Chr_NC22)

**18**  [†](#n2_Chr_CR82) Solomon made all these things in great quantities, for the weight of the bronze was not sought.

**19**  So Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of God: the golden altar, [†](#n2_Chr_CR83) the tables for the bread of the Presence,

**20**  the lampstands and their lamps of pure gold [†](#n2_Chr_CR84) to burn before the inner sanctuary, as prescribed;

**21**  the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of purest gold;

**22**  the snuffers, basins, dishes for incense, and fire pans, of pure gold, and the sockets [*](#n2_Chr_NC23) of the temple, for the inner doors to the Most Holy Place and for the doors of the nave of the temple were of gold.5 [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR85) Thus all the work that Solomon did for the house of the L**ORD** was finished. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, and stored the silver, the gold, and all the vessels in the treasuries of the house of God.

**2** [✞] Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the fathers’ houses of the people of Israel, in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the L**ORD** out of [†](#n2_Chr_CR86) the city of David, which is Zion.

**3** [✞] And all the men of Israel assembled before the king at the feast that is in the seventh month.

**4**  And all the elders of Israel came, [†](#n2_Chr_CR87) and the Levites took up the ark.

**5** [✞] And they brought up the ark, the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent; [†](#n2_Chr_CR88) the Levitical priests brought them up.

**6**  And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who had assembled before him, were before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered.

**7**  Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the L**ORD** to its place, in the inner sanctuary of the house, in the Most Holy Place, underneath the wings of the cherubim.

**8**  The cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubim made a covering above the ark and its poles.

**9** [✞] And the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen [†](#n2_Chr_CR89) from the Holy Place before the inner sanctuary, but they could not be seen from outside. And they are [*](#n2_Chr_NC24) there to this day.

**10** [✞] There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets [†](#n2_Chr_CR90) that Moses put there at Horeb, where the L**ORD** made a covenant with the people of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.

**11** [✞] And when the priests came out of the Holy Place (for all the priests who were present had consecrated themselves, without regard to [†](#n2_Chr_CR91) their divisions,

**12**  and all the Levitical [†](#n2_Chr_CR92) singers, [†](#n2_Chr_CR93) Asaph, [†](#n2_Chr_CR94) Heman, and Jeduthun, their sons and kinsmen, arrayed in fine linen, with [†](#n2_Chr_CR95) cymbals, harps, and lyres, stood east of the altar with 120 [†](#n2_Chr_CR96) priests who were trumpeters;

**13** [✞] and it was the duty of the trumpeters and singers to make themselves heard in unison in praise and thanksgiving to the L**ORD**), and when the song was raised, [†](#n2_Chr_CR97) with trumpets and cymbals and other musical instruments, in praise to the L**ORD**,

> [†](#n2_Chr_CR98) “For he is good,

  > for his steadfast love endures forever,”

6 [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR100) Then Solomon said, “The L**ORD** has said that he would dwell in thick darkness.

**2** [✞] But I have built you [†](#n2_Chr_CR101) an exalted house, a place for you to dwell in forever.”

**3**  Then the king turned around and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel stood.

**4**  And he said, “Blessed be the L**ORD**, the God of Israel, who with his hand has fulfilled what he promised with his mouth to David my father, saying,

**5** [✞] ‘Since the day that I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house, that my name might be there, and I chose no man as prince over my people Israel;

**6** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR102) but I have chosen Jerusalem that my name may be there, [†](#n2_Chr_CR103) and I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.’

**7**  [†](#n2_Chr_CR104) Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the L**ORD**, the God of Israel.

**8**  But the L**ORD** said to David my father, ‘Whereas [†](#n2_Chr_CR105) it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart.

**9** [✞] Nevertheless, it is not you who shall build the house, but your son who shall be born to you shall build the house for my name.’

**10** [✞] Now the L**ORD** has fulfilled his promise that he made. For I have risen in the place of David my father and sit on the throne of Israel, as the L**ORD** promised, and I have built the house for the name of the L**ORD**, the God of Israel.

**11**  And there I have set the ark, [†](#n2_Chr_CR106) in which is the covenant of the L**ORD** that he made with the people of Israel.”

**12**  Then Solomon stood before the altar of the L**ORD** in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and spread out his hands.

**13** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR107) Solomon had made a bronze platform five cubits [*](#n2_Chr_NC25) long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high, and had set it in the court, and he stood on it. [†](#n2_Chr_CR108) Then he knelt on his knees in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands toward heaven,

**14** [✞] and said, “O L**ORD**, God of Israel, [†](#n2_Chr_CR109) there is no God like you, in heaven or on earth, [†](#n2_Chr_CR110) keeping covenant and showing steadfast love to your servants who walk before you with all their heart,

**15**  [†](#n2_Chr_CR111) who have kept with your servant David my father what you declared to him. You spoke with your mouth, and with your hand have fulfilled it this day.

**16** [✞] Now therefore, O L**ORD**, God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father what you have promised him, saying, [†](#n2_Chr_CR112) ‘You shall not lack a man to sit before me on the throne of Israel, [†](#n2_Chr_CR113) if only your sons pay close attention to their way, to walk in my law as you have walked before me.’

**17** [✞] Now therefore, O L**ORD**, God of Israel, let your word be confirmed, which you have spoken to your servant David.

**18** [✞] “But will God indeed dwell with man on the earth? Behold, [†](#n2_Chr_CR114) heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain you, how much less this house that I have built!

**19** [✞] Yet have regard to the prayer of your servant and to his plea, O L**ORD** my God, listening to the cry and to the prayer that your servant prays before you,

**20** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR115) that your eyes may be open day and night toward this house, the place where you have promised to set your name, that you may listen to the prayer that your servant offers toward this place.

**21** [✞] And listen to the pleas of your servant and of your people Israel, when they pray toward this place. And listen from heaven your dwelling place, [†](#n2_Chr_CR116) and when you hear, forgive.

**22** [✞] “If a man sins against his neighbor and is made to take an oath and comes and swears his oath before your altar in this house,

**23**  then hear from heaven and act and judge your servants, repaying the guilty by bringing his conduct on his own head, and vindicating the righteous by rewarding him according to his righteousness.

**24** [✞] “If your people Israel are defeated before the enemy because they have sinned against you, and they turn again and acknowledge your name and pray and plead with you in this house,

**25**  [†](#n2_Chr_CR117) then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them again to the land that you gave to them and to their fathers.

**26** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR118) “When heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against you, if they pray toward this place and acknowledge your name and turn from their sin, when you afflict [*](#n2_Chr_NC26) them,

**27**  [†](#n2_Chr_CR119) then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel, when you teach them the good way [*](#n2_Chr_NC27) in which they should walk, and grant rain upon your land, which you have given to your people as an inheritance.

**28** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR120) “If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence or blight or mildew or locust or caterpillar, if their enemies besiege them in the land at their gates, whatever plague, whatever sickness there is,

**29**  whatever prayer, whatever plea is made by any man or by all your people Israel, each knowing his own affliction and his own sorrow and stretching out his hands toward this house,

**30**  [†](#n2_Chr_CR121) then hear from heaven your dwelling place and forgive and render to each whose heart you know, according to all his ways, [†](#n2_Chr_CR122) for you, you only, know the hearts of the children of mankind,

**31**  that they may fear you and walk in your ways all the days that they live in the land that you gave to our fathers.

**32** [✞] “Likewise, when a foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, comes from a far country for the sake of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm, when he comes and prays toward this house,

**33** [✞] hear from heaven your dwelling place and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to you, in order that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your people Israel, and that they may know that this house [†](#n2_Chr_CR123) that I have built is called by your name.

**34** [✞] “If your people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatever way you shall send them, and they pray to you toward this city that you have chosen and the house that I have built for your name,

**35**  then hear from heaven their prayer and their plea, and maintain their cause.

**36** [✞] “If they sin against you—[†](#n2_Chr_CR124) for there is no one who does not sin—and you are angry with them and give them to an enemy, so that they are carried away captive to a land far or near,

**37** [✞] yet if they turn their heart in the land to which they have been carried captive, and repent and plead with you in the land of their captivity, saying, ‘We have sinned and have acted perversely and wickedly,’

**38** [✞] if they repent with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity to which they were carried captive, and pray toward their land, which you gave to their fathers, the city that you have chosen and the house that I have built for your name,

**39**  then hear from heaven your dwelling place their prayer and their pleas, and maintain their cause and forgive your people who have sinned against you.

**40**  Now, O my God, [†](#n2_Chr_CR125) let your eyes be open [†](#n2_Chr_CR126) and your ears attentive to the prayer of this place.

> **41** [✞] “And now arise, O L**ORD** God, and go to your [†](#n2_Chr_CR127) resting place,

  > you and the ark of your might.

> Let your priests, O L**ORD** God, be [†](#n2_Chr_CR128) clothed with salvation,

  > and let your saints [†](#n2_Chr_CR129) rejoice in your goodness.

> **42** [✞] O L**ORD** God, [†](#n2_Chr_CR130) do not turn away the face of your anointed one!

  > [†](#n2_Chr_CR131) Remember your steadfast love for David your servant.”

7 [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR132) As soon as Solomon finished his prayer, [†](#n2_Chr_CR133) fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, [†](#n2_Chr_CR134) and the glory of the L**ORD** filled the temple.

**2** [✞] And the priests could not enter the house of the L**ORD**, because the glory of the L**ORD** filled the L**ORD**’s house.

**3** [✞] When all the people of Israel saw the fire come down and the glory of the L**ORD** on the temple, they bowed down with their faces to the ground on the pavement and worshiped and gave thanks to the L**ORD**, saying, “For he is good, [†](#n2_Chr_CR135) for his steadfast love endures forever.”

**4**  [†](#n2_Chr_CR136) Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before the L**ORD**.

**5**  King Solomon offered as a sacrifice 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.

**6** [✞] The priests stood at their posts; [†](#n2_Chr_CR137) the Levites also, with the instruments for music to the L**ORD** that King David had made for giving thanks to the L**ORD**—[†](#n2_Chr_CR138) for his steadfast love endures forever—whenever David offered praises by their ministry; [*](#n2_Chr_NC28) [†](#n2_Chr_CR139) opposite them the priests sounded trumpets, and all Israel stood.

**7**  [†](#n2_Chr_CR140) And Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was before the house of the L**ORD**, for there he offered the burnt offering and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar Solomon had made could not hold the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat.

**8** [✞] At that time Solomon held the feast for seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from [†](#n2_Chr_CR141) Lebo-hamath to the [†](#n2_Chr_CR142) Brook of Egypt.

**9**  And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, for they had kept the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast seven days.

**10** [✞] On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their homes, joyful and glad of heart for the prosperity [*](#n2_Chr_NC28a) that the L**ORD** had granted to David and to Solomon and to Israel his people.

**11** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR143) Thus Solomon finished the house of the L**ORD** and the king’s house. All that Solomon had planned to do in the house of the L**ORD** and in his own house he successfully accomplished.

**12**  Then the L**ORD** appeared to Solomon in the night and said to him: “I have heard your prayer [†](#n2_Chr_CR144) and have chosen this place for myself as a house of sacrifice.

**13** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR145) When I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or command the locust to devour the land, or send pestilence among my people,

**14** [✞] if my people who are called by my name [†](#n2_Chr_CR146) humble themselves, and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land.

**15**  [†](#n2_Chr_CR147) Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayer that is made in this place.

**16** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR148) For now I have chosen and consecrated this house that my name may be there forever. My eyes and my heart will be there for all time.

**17** [✞] And as for you, if you will walk before me as David your father walked, doing according to all that I have commanded you and keeping my statutes and my rules,

**18**  then I will establish your royal throne, as I covenanted with David your father, saying, [†](#n2_Chr_CR149) ‘You shall not lack a man to rule Israel.’

**19** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR150) “But if you [*](#n2_Chr_NC29) turn aside and forsake my statutes and my commandments that I have set before you, and go and serve other gods and worship them,

**20** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR151) then I will pluck you [*](#n2_Chr_NC30) up from my land that I have given you, and this house that I have consecrated for my name, I will cast out of my sight, and I will make it [†](#n2_Chr_CR152) a proverb and a byword among all peoples.

**21**  And at this house, which was exalted, everyone passing by will be astonished and say, [†](#n2_Chr_CR153) ‘Why has the L**ORD** done thus to this land and to this house?’

**22**  Then they will say, ‘Because they abandoned the L**ORD**, the God of their fathers who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods and worshiped them and served them. Therefore he has brought all this disaster on them.’”8 [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR154) At the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the house of the L**ORD** and his own house,

**2** [✞] Solomon rebuilt the cities that Hiram had given to him, and settled the people of Israel in them.

**3** [✞] And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and took it.

**4** [✞] He built Tadmor in the wilderness and all the store cities that he built in Hamath.

**5** [✞] He also built [†](#n2_Chr_CR155) Upper Beth-horon and Lower Beth-horon, [†](#n2_Chr_CR156) fortified cities [†](#n2_Chr_CR156) with walls, gates, and bars,

**6** [✞] and Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had and all the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen, and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.

**7**  [†](#n2_Chr_CR157) All the people who were left of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel,

**8** [✞] from their descendants who were left after them in the land, whom the people of Israel had not destroyed—these Solomon drafted [†](#n2_Chr_CR158) as forced labor, and so they are to this day.

**9**  But of the people of Israel Solomon made no slaves for his work; they were soldiers, and his officers, the commanders of his chariots, and his horsemen.

**10**  And these were the chief officers of King Solomon, 250, who exercised authority over the people.

**11** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR159) Solomon brought Pharaoh’s daughter up from the city of David to the house that he had built for her, for he said, “My wife shall not live in the house of David king of Israel, for the places to which the ark of the L**ORD** has come are holy.”

**12** [✞] Then Solomon offered up burnt offerings to the L**ORD** on the altar of the L**ORD** [†](#n2_Chr_CR160)that he had built before the vestibule,

**13**  [†](#n2_Chr_CR161) as the duty of each day required, offering [†](#n2_Chr_CR162) according to the commandment of Moses for the Sabbaths, the new moons, and the [†](#n2_Chr_CR163) three annual feasts—the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Booths.

**14**  According to the ruling of David his father, he appointed [†](#n2_Chr_CR164) the divisions of the priests for their service, [†](#n2_Chr_CR165) and the Levites for their offices of praise and [†](#n2_Chr_CR166) ministry before the priests [†](#n2_Chr_CR167) as the duty of each day required, and [†](#n2_Chr_CR168) the gatekeepers in their divisions at each gate, for so David [†](#n2_Chr_CR169) the man of God had commanded.

**15**  And they did not turn aside from what the king had commanded the priests and Levites concerning any matter and concerning the treasuries.

**16**  Thus was accomplished all the work of Solomon from [*](#n2_Chr_NC31) the day the foundation of the house of the L**ORD** was laid until it was finished. So the house of the L**ORD** was completed.

**17** [✞] Then Solomon went to [†](#n2_Chr_CR170) Ezion-geber and [†](#n2_Chr_CR171) Eloth on the shore of the sea, in the land of Edom.

**18** [✞] And Hiram sent to him by the hand of his servants ships and servants familiar with the sea, and they went to Ophir together with the servants of Solomon and brought from there [†](#n2_Chr_CR172) 450 talents [*](#n2_Chr_NC32) of gold and brought it to King Solomon.9 [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR173) Now when [†](#n2_Chr_CR174) the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions, having a very great retinue and camels bearing spices and very much gold and precious stones. And when she came to Solomon, she told him all that was on her mind.

**2**  And Solomon answered all her questions. There was nothing hidden from Solomon that he could not explain to her.

**3**  And when [†](#n2_Chr_CR175) the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built,

**4**  the food of his table, the seating of his officials, and the attendance of his servants, and their clothing, his cupbearers, and their clothing, and his burnt offerings that he offered at the house of the L**ORD**, there was no more breath in her.

**5**  And she said to the king, “The report was true that I heard in my own land of your words and of your wisdom,

**6**  but I did not believe the [*](#n2_Chr_NC33) reports until I came and my own eyes had seen it. And behold, half the greatness of your wisdom was not told me; you surpass the report that I heard.

**7**  Happy are your wives! [*](#n2_Chr_NC34) Happy are these your servants, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom!

**8** [✞] Blessed be the L**ORD** your God, who has delighted in you [†](#n2_Chr_CR176) and set you on his throne as king for the L**ORD** your God! [†](#n2_Chr_CR177) Because your God loved Israel and would establish them forever, he has made you king over them, that you may execute justice and righteousness.”

**9**  Then she gave the king 120 talents [*](#n2_Chr_NC35) of gold, and a very great quantity of spices, and precious stones. There were no spices such as those that the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.

**10** [✞] Moreover, the servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon, [†](#n2_Chr_CR178) who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum wood and precious stones.

**11**  And the king made from the algum wood [†](#n2_Chr_CR179) supports for the house of the L**ORD** and for the king’s house, lyres also and harps for the singers. There never was seen the like of them before in the land of Judah.

**12**  And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all that she desired, whatever she asked [†](#n2_Chr_CR180) besides what she had brought to the king. So she turned and went back to her own land with her servants.

**13**  [†](#n2_Chr_CR181) Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was 666 talents of gold,

**14** [✞] besides that which the explorers and merchants brought. [†](#n2_Chr_CR182) And all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land brought gold and silver to Solomon.

**15**  King Solomon made 200 large shields of beaten gold; 600 shekels [*](#n2_Chr_NC36) of beaten gold went into each shield.

**16** [✞] And he made 300 shields of beaten gold; [†](#n2_Chr_CR183) 300 shekels of gold went into each shield; and the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.

**17**  The king also made a great ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold.

**18**  The throne had six steps and a footstool of gold, which were attached to the throne, and on each side of the seat were armrests and two lions standing beside the armrests,

**19**  while twelve lions stood there, one on each end of a step on the six steps. Nothing like it was ever made for any kingdom.

**20**  All King Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. Silver was not considered as anything in the days of Solomon.

**21** [✞] For the king’s ships went to [†](#n2_Chr_CR184) Tarshish with the servants of Hiram. Once every three years the ships of Tarshish used to come bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks. [*](#n2_Chr_NC37)

**22**  Thus King Solomon [†](#n2_Chr_CR185) excelled all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.

**23** [✞] And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put into his mind.

**24**  Every one of them brought his present, articles of silver and of gold, garments, myrrh, [*](#n2_Chr_NC37a) spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year.

**25**  And Solomon had [†](#n2_Chr_CR186) 4,000 stalls for horses and chariots, and 12,000 horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.

**26**  [†](#n2_Chr_CR187) And he ruled over all the kings [†](#n2_Chr_CR188) from the Euphrates [*](#n2_Chr_NC38) to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt.

**27** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR189) And the king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stone, and he made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephelah.

**28** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR190) And horses were imported for Solomon from Egypt and from all lands.

**29** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR191) Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, from [†](#n2_Chr_CR192) first to last, are they not written in the history of [†](#n2_Chr_CR193) Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of [†](#n2_Chr_CR194) Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of [†](#n2_Chr_CR195) Iddo [†](#n2_Chr_CR196) the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?

**30**  Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.

**31**  And Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in [†](#n2_Chr_CR197) the city of David his father, and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.10 [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR198) Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.

**2** [✞] And as soon as Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was in Egypt, [†](#n2_Chr_CR199) where he had fled from King Solomon), then Jeroboam returned from Egypt.

**3** [✞] And they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all Israel came and said to Rehoboam,

**4**  [†](#n2_Chr_CR200) “Your father made our yoke heavy. Now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke on us, and we will serve you.”

**5** [✞] He said to them, “Come to me again in three days.” So the people went away.

**6**  Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, [*](#n2_Chr_NC39) who had stood before Solomon his father while he was yet alive, saying, “How do you advise me to answer this people?”

**7**  And they said to him, [†](#n2_Chr_CR201) “If you will be good to this people and please them and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.”

**8**  But he abandoned the counsel that the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him and stood before him.

**9**  And he said to them, “What do you advise that we answer this people who have said to me, ‘Lighten the yoke that your father put on us’?”

**10**  And the young men who had grown up with him said to him, “Thus shall you speak to the people who said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you lighten it for us’; thus shall you say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s thighs.

**11** [✞] And now, whereas my father laid on you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.’”

**12**  So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king said, “Come to me again the third day.”

**13**  And the king answered them harshly; and forsaking the counsel of the old men,

**14**  King Rehoboam spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.”

**15** [✞] So the king did not listen to the people, for it was a turn of affairs brought about by God that the L**ORD** might fulfill his word, [†](#n2_Chr_CR202) which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

**16** [✞] And when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, “What portion have we in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. [†](#n2_Chr_CR203) Each of you to your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, David.” So all Israel went to their tents.

**17**  But Rehoboam reigned over the people of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah.

**18** [✞] Then King Rehoboam sent [†](#n2_Chr_CR204) Hadoram, [*](#n2_Chr_NC40) who was taskmaster over the forced labor, and the people of Israel stoned him to death with stones. And King Rehoboam quickly mounted his chariot to flee to Jerusalem.

**19** [✞] So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.11 [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR205) When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, 180,000 chosen warriors, to fight against Israel, to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam.

**2** [✞] But the word of the L**ORD** came to [†](#n2_Chr_CR206) Shemaiah the man of God:

**3** [✞] “Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin,

**4** [✞] ‘Thus says the L**ORD**, You shall not go up or fight against [†](#n2_Chr_CR207) your relatives. Return every man to his home, for this thing is from me.’” So they listened to the word of the L**ORD** and returned and did not go against Jeroboam.

**5** [✞] Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and he built [†](#n2_Chr_CR208) cities for defense in Judah.

**6**  He built Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,

**7**  Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam,

**8**  Gath, [†](#n2_Chr_CR209) Mareshah, Ziph,

**9**  Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,

**10**  Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, fortified cities that are in Judah and in Benjamin.

**11**  He made the fortresses strong, and put commanders in them, and stores of food, oil, and wine.

**12**  And he put shields and spears in all the cities and made them very strong. So he held Judah and Benjamin.

**13** [✞] And the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel presented themselves to him from all places where they lived.

**14** [✞] For the Levites left [†](#n2_Chr_CR210) their common lands and their holdings and came to Judah and Jerusalem, [†](#n2_Chr_CR211) because Jeroboam and his sons cast them out from serving as priests of the L**ORD**,

**15** [✞] and he appointed his own [†](#n2_Chr_CR212) priests for the high places and for the goat idols and for [†](#n2_Chr_CR213) the calves that he had made.

**16** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR214) And those who had set their hearts to seek the L**ORD** God of Israel came after them from all the tribes of Israel to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the L**ORD**, the God of their fathers.

**17** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR215) They strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and for three years they made Rehoboam the son of Solomon secure, for they walked for three years in the way of David and Solomon.

**18** [✞] Rehoboam took as wife Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and of Abihail the daughter of [†](#n2_Chr_CR216) Eliab the son of Jesse,

**19**  and she bore him sons, Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham.

**20** [✞] After her he took [†](#n2_Chr_CR217) Maacah the daughter of Absalom, who bore him [†](#n2_Chr_CR218) Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.

**21**  Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and concubines (he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and fathered twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters).

**22** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR219) And Rehoboam appointed [†](#n2_Chr_CR220) Abijah the son of Maacah as chief prince among his brothers, for he intended to make him king.

**23** [✞] And he dealt wisely and distributed some of his sons through all the districts of Judah and Benjamin, in all the fortified cities, and he gave them abundant provisions and procured wives for them. [*](#n2_Chr_NC41)12 [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR221) When the rule of Rehoboam was established [†](#n2_Chr_CR222) and he was strong, [†](#n2_Chr_CR223) he abandoned the law of the L**ORD**, and all Israel with him.

**2** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR224) In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, because they had been unfaithful to the L**ORD**, [†](#n2_Chr_CR225) Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem

**3** [✞] with 1,200 chariots and 60,000 horsemen. And the people were without number who came with him from Egypt—[†](#n2_Chr_CR226) Libyans, Sukkiim, and Ethiopians.

**4** [✞] And he took [†](#n2_Chr_CR227) the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem.

**5** [✞] Then [†](#n2_Chr_CR228) Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and to the princes of Judah, who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, “Thus says the L**ORD**, [†](#n2_Chr_CR229) ‘You abandoned me, so I have abandoned you to the hand of Shishak.’”

**6** [✞] Then the princes of [†](#n2_Chr_CR230) Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, [†](#n2_Chr_CR231) “The L**ORD** is righteous.”

**7** [✞] When the L**ORD** saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the L**ORD** came to Shemaiah: [†](#n2_Chr_CR232) “They have humbled themselves. I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance, [†](#n2_Chr_CR233) and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.

**8** [✞] Nevertheless, they shall be servants to him, [†](#n2_Chr_CR234) that they may know my service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.”

**9** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR235) So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem. He took away the treasures of the house of the L**ORD** and the treasures of the king’s house. He took away everything. He also took away [†](#n2_Chr_CR236) the shields of gold that Solomon had made,

**10**  and King Rehoboam made in their place shields of bronze and committed them to the hands of the officers of the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house.

**11**  And as often as the king went into the house of the L**ORD**, the guard came and carried them and brought them back to the guardroom.

**12** [✞] And when [†](#n2_Chr_CR237) he humbled himself the wrath of the L**ORD** turned from him, so as not to make a complete destruction. Moreover, [†](#n2_Chr_CR238) conditions were good [*](#n2_Chr_NC42) in Judah.

**13**  [†](#n2_Chr_CR239) So King Rehoboam grew strong in Jerusalem and reigned. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city that the L**ORD** had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there. His mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonite.

**14** [✞] And he did evil, [†](#n2_Chr_CR240) for he did not set his heart to seek the L**ORD**.

**15** [✞] [†](#n2_Chr_CR241) Now the acts of Rehoboam, [†](#n2_Chr_CR242) from first to last, are they not written in the chronicles of [†](#n2_Chr_CR243) Shemaiah the prophet and of [†](#n2_Chr_CR244) Iddo [†](#n2_Chr_CR245) the seer? [*](#n2_Chr_NC43) There were continual wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam.

**16**  And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David, and [†](#n2_Chr_CR246) Abijah [*](#n2_Chr_NC44) his son reigned in his place.
