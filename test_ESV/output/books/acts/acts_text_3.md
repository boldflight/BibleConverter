## HUMAN BEINGS AS BODY AND SOUL

H uman beings, created in the image and likeness of God, are creatures made out of a material body and a nonmaterial soul. The soul is sometimes referred to as spirit.

Both body and soul are created by God and are distinct aspects of our personal makeup. The biblical view of human beings differs sharply from early Greek views. Our body and soul make up a duality, not a dualism. In Greek dualistic theories the body and soul are seen as incompatible substances that coexist in constant tension. They are fundamentally incompatible. Usually dualism asserts that there is something inherently evil or imperfect about anything physical and therefore sees the body as an evil container for the pure soul. For the Greek, salvation ultimately meant redemption from the body when the soul is finally released from the prison house of the flesh.

The biblical view of the body is that it is created good and has no inherent evil in its physical substance. Yet it suffers from moral corruption just like the soul. Human beings are sinful in both body and soul. Christianity, far from teaching redemption from the body, teaches redemption of the body.

As a duality, human beings are one entity with two distinct parts united by God’s act of creation. There is no necessity, either philosophically or exegetically, to add a third part or substance (such as spirit) to bridge a dualistic tension. Orthodox theology rejects the trichotomous view of human beings, by which we are conceived of in three distinct parts: body, soul, and spirit.

Though many theologians have argued for the natural or essential immortality of the human soul, it is important to remember that the human soul is: (1) created by God and is not inherently eternal; (2) though not composed of matter and open to dissolution by physical forces, it is nevertheless capable of being destroyed by God. The soul cannot exist for a moment apart from the sustaining power of God. “In him we live and move and have our being” (Acts 17:28).

At death, though the body dies, the soul of both the believer and unbeliever continues to live. Believers await the consummation of their redemption with the resurrection and glorification of their bodies, while the impenitent await the eternal judgment of God. Because God preserves the soul from death, human beings have a continuity of conscious personal existence beyond the grave. The whole person is fallen; both body and soul are the objects of God’s saving grace.

### The Jerusalem Council

**6** [✞] [†](#Act_CR934) The [†](#Act_CR935) apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider this matter.

**7** [✞] And after there had been much [†](#Act_CR936) debate, Peter stood up and said to them, “Brothers, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, [†](#Act_CR937) that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear [†](#Act_CR938) the word of [†](#Act_CR939) the gospel and believe.

**8**  And God, [†](#Act_CR940) who knows the heart, [†](#Act_CR941) bore witness to them, [†](#Act_CR942) by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us,

**9**  and [†](#Act_CR943) he made no distinction between us and them, [†](#Act_CR944) having cleansed their hearts [†](#Act_CR945) by faith.

**10** [✞] Now, therefore, why [†](#Act_CR946) are you putting God to the test [†](#Act_CR947) by placing a yoke on the neck of the disciples [†](#Act_CR948) that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?

**11**  But we [†](#Act_CR949) believe that we will be [†](#Act_CR950) saved through [†](#Act_CR951) the grace of the Lord Jesus, [†](#Act_CR952) just as they will.”

**12**  And all the assembly fell silent, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul [†](#Act_CR953) as they related what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles.

**13** [✞] After they finished speaking, [†](#Act_CR954) James replied, “Brothers, listen to me.

**14**  [†](#Act_CR955) Simeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles, to take from them [†](#Act_CR956) a people for his name.

**15**  And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written,

> **16** [✞] [†](#Act_CR957) “‘After this I will return,

> and I will rebuild the tent of David that has fallen;

> I will rebuild its ruins,

  > and I will restore it,

> **17**  that the remnant [*](#Acts_NC52) of mankind [†](#Act_CR958) may seek the Lord,

  > and all the Gentiles [†](#Act_CR959) who are called by my name,

  > says the Lord, who makes these things 
> **18**  [†](#Act_CR960) known from of old.’

**22** [✞] Then it seemed good to [†](#Act_CR968) the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They sent Judas called [†](#Act_CR969) Barsabbas, and [†](#Act_CR970) Silas, leading men among [†](#Act_CR971) the brothers,

**23** [✞] with the following letter: [†](#Act_CR972) “The brothers, both [†](#Act_CR973) the apostles and the elders, to the brothers [*](#Acts_NC53) who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, [†](#Act_CR974) greetings.

**24**  Since we have heard that [†](#Act_CR975) some persons have gone out from us and [†](#Act_CR976) troubled you [*](#Acts_NC54) with words, unsettling your minds, although we gave them no instructions,

**25**  it has seemed good to us, having come [†](#Act_CR977) to one accord, to choose men and send them to you with our [†](#Act_CR978) beloved Barnabas and Paul,

**26**  [†](#Act_CR979) men who have [†](#Act_CR980) risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

**27**  We have therefore sent [†](#Act_CR981) Judas and Silas, who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth.

**28** [✞] For it has seemed good [†](#Act_CR982) to the Holy Spirit and [†](#Act_CR983) to us [†](#Act_CR984) to lay on you no greater burden than these requirements:

**29**  [†](#Act_CR985) that you abstain from [†](#Act_CR986) what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.”

**30**  So when they were sent off, they went down to Antioch, and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter.

**31** [✞] And when they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement.

**32** [✞] And Judas and Silas, who were themselves [†](#Act_CR987) prophets, encouraged and [†](#Act_CR988) strengthened [†](#Act_CR989) the brothers with many words.

**33**  And after they had spent some time, they were sent off [†](#Act_CR990) in peace by [†](#Act_CR991) the brothers to those who had sent them. [*](#Acts_NC55)

**35**  But [†](#Act_CR992) Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.

**36**  And after some days Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us return and visit [†](#Act_CR993) the brothers [†](#Act_CR994) in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are.”

**37**  Now Barnabas wanted to take with them [†](#Act_CR995) John called Mark.

**38**  But Paul thought best not to take with them one [†](#Act_CR996) who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work.

**39** [✞] And there arose [†](#Act_CR997) a sharp disagreement, so that they separated from each other. [†](#Act_CR998) Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus,

**40** [✞] but Paul chose Silas and departed, [†](#Act_CR999) having been commended by [†](#Act_CR1000) the brothers to [†](#Act_CR1001) the grace of the Lord.

**41**  And he went through Syria and Cilicia, [†](#Act_CR1002) strengthening the churches.

**6** [✞] And [†](#Act_CR1013) they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.

**7** [✞] And when they had come up to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but [†](#Act_CR1014) the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.

**8** [✞] So, passing by Mysia, they went down [†](#Act_CR1015) to Troas.

**9** [✞] And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing there, urging him and saying, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.”

**10** [✞] And when Paul [*](#Acts_NC58) had seen the vision, immediately [†](#Act_CR1016) we sought to go on into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.

**11** [✞] So, setting sail from Troas, we [†](#Act_CR1017) made a direct voyage to Samothrace, and the following day to Neapolis,

**12** [✞] and from there to [†](#Act_CR1018) Philippi, which is a leading city of the [*](#Acts_NC59) district of Macedonia and [†](#Act_CR1019) a Roman colony. We remained in this city some days.

**13** [✞] And [†](#Act_CR1020) on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate [†](#Act_CR1021) to the riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we [†](#Act_CR1022) sat down and spoke to the women who had come together.

**14** [✞] One who heard us was a woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple goods, [†](#Act_CR1023) who was a worshiper of God. The Lord [†](#Act_CR1024) opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul.

**15** [✞] And after she was baptized, [†](#Act_CR1025) and her household as well, she urged us, saying, “If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay.” And she [†](#Act_CR1026) prevailed upon us.

**16** [✞] As we were going to [†](#Act_CR1027) the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had [†](#Act_CR1028) a spirit of [†](#Act_CR1029) divination and [†](#Act_CR1030) brought her owners much gain by fortune-telling.

**17** [✞] She followed Paul and us, [†](#Act_CR1031) crying out, “These men are [†](#Act_CR1032) servants of [†](#Act_CR1033) the Most High God, who proclaim to you [†](#Act_CR1034) the way of salvation.”

**18** [✞] And this she kept doing for many days. Paul, having become greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, [†](#Act_CR1035) “I command you [†](#Act_CR1036) in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.” And [†](#Act_CR1037) it came out that very hour.

**19** [✞] But [†](#Act_CR1038) when her owners saw that their hope of gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and [†](#Act_CR1039) dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers.

**20**  And when they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, “These men are Jews, and they are disturbing our city.

**21** [✞] They [†](#Act_CR1040) advocate customs that are not lawful for us [†](#Act_CR1041) as Romans to accept or practice.”

**22** [✞] The crowd joined in attacking them, and the magistrates tore the garments off them and gave orders [†](#Act_CR1042) to beat them with rods.

**23**  And when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, ordering the jailer to keep them safely.

**24** [✞] Having received this order, he put them into the inner [†](#Act_CR1043) prison and fastened their feet in [†](#Act_CR1044) the stocks.

**25** [✞] [†](#Act_CR1045) About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them,

**26** [✞] and suddenly [†](#Act_CR1046) there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately [†](#Act_CR1047) all the doors were opened, and [†](#Act_CR1048) everyone’s bonds were unfastened.

**27** [✞] When the jailer woke and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and [†](#Act_CR1049) was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.

**28**  But Paul cried with a loud voice, “Do not harm yourself, for we are all here.”

**29**  And the jailer [*](#Acts_NC61) called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he [†](#Act_CR1050) fell down before Paul and Silas.

**30**  Then he brought them out and said, “Sirs, [†](#Act_CR1051) what must I do to be [†](#Act_CR1052) saved?”

**31** [✞] And they said, [†](#Act_CR1053) “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you [†](#Act_CR1054) and your household.”

**32**  And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.

**33** [✞] And he took them [†](#Act_CR1055) the same hour of the night and washed their wounds; and he [†](#Act_CR1056) was baptized at once, he and all his family.

**34** [✞] Then he brought them up into his house and set food before them. And he [†](#Act_CR1057) rejoiced along with his entire household that he had believed in God.

**35**  But when it was day, the magistrates sent the police, saying, “Let those men go.”

**36**  And the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, “The magistrates have sent to let you go. Therefore come out now and go in peace.”

**37** [✞] But Paul said to them, “They have beaten us publicly, [†](#Act_CR1058) uncondemned, men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison; and do they now throw us out secretly? No! Let them come themselves and take us out.”

**38**  The police reported these words to the magistrates, and [†](#Act_CR1059) they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens.

**39** [✞] So they came and apologized to them. And they took them out and [†](#Act_CR1060) asked them to leave the city.

**40** [✞] So they went out of the prison and visited [†](#Act_CR1061) Lydia. And when they had seen [†](#Act_CR1062) the brothers, they encouraged them and departed.

**10** [✞] [†](#Act_CR1078) The brothers [*](#Acts_NC63) immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea, and when they arrived they [†](#Act_CR1079) went into the Jewish synagogue.

**11** [✞] Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received the word with all eagerness, [†](#Act_CR1080) examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.

**12**  [†](#Act_CR1081) Many of them therefore believed, with not a few Greek [†](#Act_CR1082) women of high standing as well as men.

**13**  But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Berea also, they came there too, [†](#Act_CR1083) agitating and stirring up the crowds.

**14**  Then the brothers [†](#Act_CR1084) immediately sent Paul off on his way to the sea, but Silas and [†](#Act_CR1085) Timothy remained there.

**15**  [†](#Act_CR1086) Those who conducted Paul brought him as far as [†](#Act_CR1087) Athens, and after receiving a command [†](#Act_CR1088) for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they departed.

**16** [✞] Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was [†](#Act_CR1089) provoked within him as he saw that the city was [†](#Act_CR1090) full of idols.

**17**  So [†](#Act_CR1091) he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there.

**18** [✞] Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also conversed with him. And some said, [†](#Act_CR1092) “What does this babbler wish to say?” Others said, “He seems to be a preacher of foreign divinities”—because [†](#Act_CR1093) he was preaching [†](#Act_CR1094) Jesus and the resurrection.

**19** [✞] And they took him and brought him to [†](#Act_CR1095) the Areopagus, saying, “May we know what this [†](#Act_CR1096) new teaching is that you are presenting?

**20**  For you bring some [†](#Act_CR1097) strange things to our ears. We wish to know therefore what these things mean.”

**21**  Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there would spend their time in nothing except telling or hearing something new.

**22** [✞] So Paul, standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: “Men of Athens, I perceive that in every way you are very religious.

**23** [✞] For as I passed along and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription: [†](#Act_CR1098) ‘To the unknown god.’ [†](#Act_CR1098) What therefore you worship [†](#Act_CR1099) as unknown, this I proclaim to you.

**24** [✞] [†](#Act_CR1100) The God who made the world and everything in it, being [†](#Act_CR1101) Lord of heaven and earth, [†](#Act_CR1102) does not live in temples made by man, [*](#Acts_NC64)

**25**  nor is he served by human hands, [†](#Act_CR1103) as though he needed anything, since he himself [†](#Act_CR1104) gives to all mankind [†](#Act_CR1105) life and breath and everything.

**26** [✞] And [†](#Act_CR1106) he made from one man every nation of mankind to live [†](#Act_CR1107) on all the face of the earth, [†](#Act_CR1108) having determined allotted periods and [†](#Act_CR1109) the boundaries of their dwelling place,

**27** [✞] [†](#Act_CR1110) that they should seek God, [†](#Act_CR1111) and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him. [†](#Act_CR1112) Yet he is actually not far from each one of us,

**28** [✞] for

> [†](#Act_CR1113) “‘In him we live and move and have our being’; [*](#Acts_NC65)

> “‘For we are indeed his offspring.’ [*](#Acts_NC66)

**32** [✞] Now when they heard of [†](#Act_CR1126) the resurrection of the dead, [†](#Act_CR1127) some mocked. But others said, [†](#Act_CR1128) “We will hear you again about this.”

**33**  So Paul went out from their midst.

**34**  But some men joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius [†](#Act_CR1129) the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them.

**5** [✞] [†](#Act_CR1134) When Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul [†](#Act_CR1135) was occupied with the word, [†](#Act_CR1136) testifying to the Jews that the Christ was [†](#Act_CR1137) Jesus.

**6** [✞] And when they opposed and reviled him, [†](#Act_CR1138) he shook out his garments and said to them, [†](#Act_CR1139) “Your blood be on your own heads! [†](#Act_CR1140) I am innocent. [†](#Act_CR1141) From now on I will go to the Gentiles.”

**7** [✞] And he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius [†](#Act_CR1142) Justus, [†](#Act_CR1143) a worshiper of God. His house was next door to the synagogue.

**8** [✞] [†](#Act_CR1144) Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, together [†](#Act_CR1145) with his entire household. And many of the Corinthians hearing Paul believed and were baptized.

**9**  And the Lord said to Paul [†](#Act_CR1146) one night in [†](#Act_CR1147) a vision, [†](#Act_CR1148) “Do not be afraid, but go on speaking and do not be silent,

**10** [✞] [†](#Act_CR1149) for I am with you, and [†](#Act_CR1150) no one will attack you to harm you, for [†](#Act_CR1151) I have many in this city who are my people.”

**11**  And he stayed a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.

**12** [✞] But when Gallio was [†](#Act_CR1152) proconsul of Achaia, [†](#Act_CR1153) the Jews [*](#Acts_NC68) made a united attack on Paul and [†](#Act_CR1154) brought him before the tribunal,

**13** [✞] saying, “This man is persuading people to worship God contrary to [†](#Act_CR1155) the law.”

**14**  But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, “If it were a matter of wrongdoing or vicious [†](#Act_CR1156) crime, O Jews, I would have reason to accept your complaint.

**15**  But [†](#Act_CR1157) since it is a matter of questions about words and names and [†](#Act_CR1158) your own law, see to it yourselves. I refuse to be a judge of these things.”

**16**  And he drove them from the tribunal.

**17**  And they all seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him in front of the tribunal. But Gallio paid no attention to any of this.

**18** [✞] After this, Paul stayed many days longer and then took leave of [†](#Act_CR1159) the brothers [*](#Acts_NC69) and set sail for Syria, and with him [†](#Act_CR1160) Priscilla and Aquila. At [†](#Act_CR1161) Cenchreae [†](#Act_CR1162) he had cut his hair, for he was under a vow.

**19** [✞] And they came to [†](#Act_CR1163) Ephesus, and he left them there, but [†](#Act_CR1164) he himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.

**20**  When they asked him to stay for a longer period, he declined.

**21**  But on taking leave of them he said, “I will return to you [†](#Act_CR1165) if God wills,” and he set sail from Ephesus.

**22**  When he had landed at Caesarea, he [†](#Act_CR1166) went up and greeted the church, and then went down to Antioch.

**23** [✞] After spending some time there, he departed and [†](#Act_CR1167) went from one place to the next through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, [†](#Act_CR1168) strengthening all the disciples.

**24** [✞] Now a Jew named [†](#Act_CR1169) Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent man, [†](#Act_CR1170) competent in the Scriptures.

**25** [✞] He had been instructed in [†](#Act_CR1171) the way of the Lord. And [†](#Act_CR1172) being fervent in spirit, [*](#Acts_NC70) he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, though he knew only [†](#Act_CR1173) the baptism of John.

**26**  He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when [†](#Act_CR1174) Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him [†](#Act_CR1175) the way of God more accurately.

**27**  And when he wished to cross to [†](#Act_CR1176) Achaia, [†](#Act_CR1177) the brothers encouraged him and [†](#Act_CR1178) wrote to the disciples to welcome him. When he arrived, [†](#Act_CR1179) he greatly helped those who through grace had believed,

**28**  for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, showing by the Scriptures [†](#Act_CR1180) that the Christ was Jesus.

**8**  And [†](#Act_CR1193) he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly, reasoning and persuading them [†](#Act_CR1194) about the kingdom of God.

**9** [✞] [†](#Act_CR1195) But when some became stubborn and [†](#Act_CR1196) continued in unbelief, speaking evil of [†](#Act_CR1197) the Way before the congregation, he withdrew from them and took the disciples with him, reasoning daily in the hall of Tyrannus. [*](#Acts_NC73)

**10** [✞] This continued for [†](#Act_CR1198) two years, so that [†](#Act_CR1199) all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.

**11**  And [†](#Act_CR1200) God was doing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,

**12** [✞] [†](#Act_CR1201) so that even handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were carried away to the sick, and their diseases left them and [†](#Act_CR1202) the evil spirits came out of them.

**13** [✞] Then some of the itinerant Jewish [†](#Act_CR1203) exorcists [†](#Act_CR1204) undertook to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, [†](#Act_CR1205) “I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul proclaims.”

**14**  Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this.

**15** [✞] But the evil spirit answered them, [†](#Act_CR1206) “Jesus I know, and Paul I recognize, but who are you?”

**16**  And the man in whom was the evil spirit leaped on them, mastered all [*](#Acts_NC74) of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.

**17**  And this became known to all the residents of Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks. And fear fell upon them all, and [†](#Act_CR1207) the name of the Lord Jesus was extolled.

**18**  Also many of those who were now believers came, [†](#Act_CR1208) confessing and divulging their practices.

**19** [✞] And a number of those who had practiced magic arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all. And they counted the value of them and found it came to fifty thousand pieces of silver.

**20** [✞] So the word of the Lord [†](#Act_CR1209) continued to increase and prevail mightily.

**21**  Now after these events Paul resolved in the Spirit [†](#Act_CR1210) to pass through [†](#Act_CR1211) Macedonia and Achaia and [†](#Act_CR1212) go to Jerusalem, saying, “After I have been there, [†](#Act_CR1213) I must also see Rome.”

**22** [✞] And having sent into Macedonia two of [†](#Act_CR1214) his helpers, [†](#Act_CR1215) Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia [†](#Act_CR1216) for a while.

**23** [✞] About that time [†](#Act_CR1217) there arose no little disturbance concerning [†](#Act_CR1218) the Way.

**24** [✞] For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, [†](#Act_CR1219) brought no little business to the craftsmen.

**25**  [†](#Act_CR1220) These he gathered together, with the workmen in similar trades, and said, “Men, you know that from this business we have our wealth.

**26**  And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus but in almost all of Asia this Paul has persuaded and turned away a great many people, [†](#Act_CR1221) saying that [†](#Act_CR1222) gods made with hands are not gods.

**27** [✞] And there is danger not only that this trade of ours may come into disrepute but also that the temple of the [†](#Act_CR1223) great goddess Artemis may be counted as nothing, and that she may even be deposed from her magnificence, she whom all Asia and the world worship.”

**28**  When they heard this they were enraged and were crying out, [†](#Act_CR1224) “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”

**29**  So the city was filled with the confusion, and they rushed together into the theater, dragging with them Gaius and [†](#Act_CR1225) Aristarchus, Macedonians who were Paul’s [†](#Act_CR1226) companions in travel.

**30**  But when Paul wished to go in among the crowd, the disciples would not let him.

**31**  And even some of the Asiarchs, [*](#Acts_NC75) who were friends of his, sent to him and were urging him not to venture into the theater.

**32** [✞] [†](#Act_CR1227) Now some cried out one thing, some another, for the assembly was in confusion, and most of them did not know why they had come together.

**33**  Some of the crowd prompted Alexander, whom the Jews had put forward. And Alexander, [†](#Act_CR1228) motioning with his hand, wanted to make a defense to the crowd.

**34**  But when they recognized that he was a Jew, for about two hours they all cried out with one voice, [†](#Act_CR1229) “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”

**35**  And when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, “Men of Ephesus, who is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great Artemis, and of the sacred stone that fell from [†](#Act_CR1230) the sky? [*](#Acts_NC76)

**36**  Seeing then that these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash.

**37** [✞] For you have brought [†](#Act_CR1231) these men here who are neither [†](#Act_CR1232) sacrilegious nor blasphemers of our goddess.

**38**  If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open, and there are [†](#Act_CR1233) proconsuls. Let them bring charges against one another.

**39**  But if you seek anything further, [*](#Acts_NC77) it shall be settled in the regular assembly.

**40**  For we really are in danger of being charged with rioting today, since there is no cause that we can give to justify this commotion.”

**41**  And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.

**7** [✞] [†](#Act_CR1243) On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together [†](#Act_CR1244) to break bread, Paul talked with them, intending to depart on the next day, and he prolonged his speech until midnight.

**8** [✞] There were many lamps in [†](#Act_CR1245) the upper room where we were gathered.

**9**  And a young man named Eutychus, sitting at the window, sank into a deep sleep as Paul talked still longer. And being overcome by sleep, he [†](#Act_CR1246) fell down from the third story and was taken up dead.

**10**  But Paul went down and [†](#Act_CR1247) bent over him, and taking him in his arms, said, [†](#Act_CR1248) “Do not be alarmed, for his life is in him.”

**11**  And when Paul had gone up and [†](#Act_CR1249) had broken bread and eaten, he conversed with them a long while, until daybreak, and so departed.

**12**  And they took the youth away alive, and were not a little comforted.

**13** [✞] But going ahead to the ship, we set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there, for so he had arranged, intending himself to go by land.

**14**  And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and went to Mitylene.

**15** [✞] And sailing from there we came the following day opposite Chios; the next day we touched at Samos; and [*](#Acts_NC79) the day after that we went to Miletus.

**16**  For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he might not have to spend time in Asia, for he was hastening [†](#Act_CR1250) to be at Jerusalem, if possible, [†](#Act_CR1251) on the day of Pentecost.

**17** [✞] Now from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called [†](#Act_CR1252) the elders of the church to come to him.

**18**  And when they came to him, he said to them:[†](#Act_CR1253) “You yourselves know [†](#Act_CR1254) how I lived among you the whole time [†](#Act_CR1253) from the first day that I set foot in Asia,

**19**  [†](#Act_CR1255) serving the Lord [†](#Act_CR1256) with all humility and with [†](#Act_CR1257) tears and with trials that happened to me through [†](#Act_CR1258) the plots of the Jews;

**20** [✞] how I [†](#Act_CR1259) did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and [†](#Act_CR1260) teaching you in public and from house to house,

**21** [✞] [†](#Act_CR1261) testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of [†](#Act_CR1262) repentance toward God and of [†](#Act_CR1263) faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.[*](#Acts_NC80a)

**22** [✞] And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, constrained [†](#Act_CR1264) by [*](#Acts_NC80) the Spirit, not knowing what will happen to me there,

**23**  except that [†](#Act_CR1265) the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that [†](#Act_CR1266) imprisonment and [†](#Act_CR1267) afflictions await me.

**24**  But [†](#Act_CR1268) I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself, if only [†](#Act_CR1269) I may finish my course and [†](#Act_CR1270) the ministry [†](#Act_CR1271) that I received from the Lord Jesus, [†](#Act_CR1272) to testify to [†](#Act_CR1273) the gospel of [†](#Act_CR1274) the grace of God.

**25** [✞] And now, behold, [†](#Act_CR1275) I know that none of you among whom I have gone about [†](#Act_CR1276) proclaiming the kingdom will see my face again.

**26** [✞] Therefore [†](#Act_CR1277) I testify to you this day that [†](#Act_CR1278) I am innocent of the blood of all,

**27** [✞] for [†](#Act_CR1279) I did not shrink from declaring to you [†](#Act_CR1280) the whole counsel of God.

**28** [✞] [†](#Act_CR1281) Pay careful attention to yourselves and to all [†](#Act_CR1282) the flock, in which [†](#Act_CR1283) the Holy Spirit has made you [†](#Act_CR1284) overseers, [†](#Act_CR1285) to care for [†](#Act_CR1286) the church of God, [*](#Acts_NC81) which he [†](#Act_CR1287) obtained [†](#Act_CR1288) with his own blood. [*](#Acts_NC82)

**29**  I [†](#Act_CR1289) know that after my departure [†](#Act_CR1290) fierce wolves will come in among you, [†](#Act_CR1291) not sparing the flock;

**30** [✞] and [†](#Act_CR1292) from among your own selves will arise men speaking twisted things, to draw away the disciples after them.

**31**  Therefore [†](#Act_CR1293) be alert, remembering that [†](#Act_CR1294) for three years I did not cease night or day [†](#Act_CR1295) to admonish every one [†](#Act_CR1296) with tears.

**32**  And now [†](#Act_CR1297) I commend you to God and to [†](#Act_CR1298) the word of his grace, which is able to [†](#Act_CR1299) build you up and to give you [†](#Act_CR1300) the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.

**33** [✞] [†](#Act_CR1301) I coveted no one’s silver or gold or apparel.

**34**  [†](#Act_CR1302) You yourselves know that [†](#Act_CR1303) these hands ministered to my necessities and [†](#Act_CR1304) to those who were with me.

**35** [✞] In all things [†](#Act_CR1305) I have shown you that [†](#Act_CR1306) by working hard in this way we must [†](#Act_CR1307) help the weak and [†](#Act_CR1308) remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, ‘It is more blessed [†](#Act_CR1309) to give than to receive.’”

**36**  And when he had said these things, [†](#Act_CR1310) he knelt down and prayed with them all.

**37** [✞] And [†](#Act_CR1311) there was much weeping on the part of all; [†](#Act_CR1312) they embraced Paul and [†](#Act_CR1312) kissed him,

**38**  being sorrowful most of all because of [†](#Act_CR1313) the word he had spoken, that they would not see his face again. And [†](#Act_CR1314) they accompanied him to the ship.
