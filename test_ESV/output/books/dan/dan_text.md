## THE WILL OF GOD

T he Bible is deeply concerned about the will of God—His sovereign authority over His creation and everything in it. When we speak about God’s will we do so in at least three different ways. The broader concept is known as God’s _decretive, sovereign,_ or _hidden will_ . By this, theologians refer to the will of God by which He sovereignly ordains everything that comes to pass. Because God is sovereign and His will can never be frustrated, we can be sure that nothing happens over which He is not in control. He at least must “permit” whatever happens to happen. Yet even when God permits things to happen, He _chooses_ to permit them in that He always has the power and right to intervene and prevent the actions and events of this world. Insofar as He lets things happen, He has “willed” them in this certain sense.

Though God’s sovereign will is often hidden from us until after it comes to pass, there is one aspect of His will that is plain to us—His _preceptive_ will. Here God reveals His will through His holy law. For example, it is the will of God that we do not steal; that we love our enemies; that we repent; that we be holy. This aspect of God’s will is revealed in His Word as well as in our conscience, by which God has written His moral law upon our heart.

His laws, whether they be found in the Scripture or in the heart, are binding. We have no authority to violate this will. We have the power or the ability to thwart the preceptive will of God, though never the right to do so. Nor can we excuse ourselves for sinning by saying, “Que sera, sera.” It may be God’s sovereign or hidden will that we be “permitted” to sin, as He brings His sovereign will to pass even through and by means of the sinful acts of people. God ordained that Jesus be betrayed by the instrument of Judas’s treachery. Yet this makes Judas’s sin no less evil or treacherous. When God “permits” us to break His preceptive will, it is not to be understood as permission in the moral sense of His granting us a moral right. His permission gives us the _power,_ but not the _right_ to sin.

The third way the Bible speaks of the will of God is with respect to God’s _will of disposition_ . This will describes God’s attitude. It defines what is pleasing to Him. For example, God takes no delight in the death of the wicked, yet He most surely wills or decrees the death of the wicked. God’s ultimate delight is in His own holiness and righteousness. When He judges the world, He delights in the vindication of His own righteousness and justice, yet He is not gleeful in a vindictive sense toward those who receive His judgment. God is pleased when we find our pleasure in obedience. He is sorely displeased when we are disobedient.

Many Christians become preoccupied or even obsessed with finding the “will” of God for their lives. If the will we are seeking is His secret, hidden, or decretive will, then our quest is a fool’s errand. The secret counsel of God is His secret. He has not been pleased to make it known to us. Far from being a mark of spirituality, the quest for God’s secret will is an unwarranted invasion of God’s privacy. God’s secret counsel is none of our business. This is partly why the Bible takes such a negative view of fortune-telling, necromancy, and other forms of prohibited practices.

We would be wise to follow the counsel of John Calvin when he said, “When God closes His holy mouth, I will desist from inquiry.” The true mark of spirituality is seen in those seeking to know the will of God that is revealed in His preceptive will. It is the godly person who meditates on God’s law day and night. While we seek to be “led” by the Holy Spirit, it is vital to remember that the Holy Spirit is primarily leading us into righteousness. We are called to live our lives by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God. It is His revealed will that is our business, indeed, the chief business of our lives.

### Daniel Taken to Babylon

1 [✞] In the third year of [†](#Dn_CR1) the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.

**2** [✞] And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with some of [†](#Dn_CR2) the vessels of the house of God. And he brought them to [†](#Dn_CR3) the land of Shinar, to the house of his god, [†](#Dn_CR4) and placed the vessels in the treasury of his god.

**3**  Then the king commanded Ashpenaz, [†](#Dn_CR5) his chief eunuch, to bring some of the people of Israel, both of the royal family [*](#Dn_NC1) and of [†](#Dn_CR6) the nobility,

**4** [✞] youths without [†](#Dn_CR7) blemish, of good appearance and [†](#Dn_CR8) skillful in all wisdom, endowed with knowledge, understanding learning, and competent to stand in the king’s palace, and to [†](#Dn_CR9) teach them the literature and language of the [†](#Dn_CR10) Chaldeans.

**5** [✞] The king assigned them a daily portion of [†](#Dn_CR11) the food that the king ate, and of [†](#Dn_CR12) the wine that he drank. They were to be educated for [†](#Dn_CR13) three years, and at the end of that time they were to [†](#Dn_CR14) stand before the king.

**6** [✞] Among these were [†](#Dn_CR15) Daniel, [†](#Dn_CR16) Hananiah, [†](#Dn_CR16) Mishael, and [†](#Dn_CR16) Azariah of the tribe of Judah.

**7** [✞] And [†](#Dn_CR17) the chief of the eunuchs [†](#Dn_CR18) gave them names: [†](#Dn_CR19) Daniel he called Belteshazzar, Hananiah he called Shadrach, Mishael he called Meshach, and Azariah he called Abednego.

**8** [✞] But Daniel [†](#Dn_CR20) resolved that he would not [†](#Dn_CR21) defile himself with [†](#Dn_CR22) the king’s food, or with [†](#Dn_CR23) the wine that he drank. Therefore he asked the chief of the eunuchs to allow him not to [†](#Dn_CR21) defile himself.

**9** [✞] [†](#Dn_CR24) And God gave Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the chief of the eunuchs,

**10**  and the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, “I fear my lord the king, who assigned your food and your drink; for why should he see that you were in worse condition than the youths who are of your own age? So you would endanger my head with the king.”

**11**  Then Daniel said to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had assigned over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,

**12**  “Test your servants for [†](#Dn_CR25) ten days; let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink.

**13**  Then let our appearance and the appearance of the youths who eat [†](#Dn_CR26) the king’s food be observed by you, and deal with your servants according to what you see.”

**14**  So he listened to them in this matter, and tested them for ten days.

**15** [✞] At the end of ten days it was seen that they were better in appearance and fatter in flesh than all the youths who ate [†](#Dn_CR27) the king’s food.

**16**  [†](#Dn_CR28) So the steward took away their food and the wine they were to drink, and gave them [†](#Dn_CR29) vegetables.

**17** [✞] As for these four youths, [†](#Dn_CR30) God gave them learning and [†](#Dn_CR31) skill in all literature and wisdom, and Daniel had [†](#Dn_CR32) understanding in all visions and dreams.

**18** [✞] At the end of [†](#Dn_CR33) the time, when the king had commanded that they should be brought in, the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.

**19**  And the king spoke with them, and among all of them none was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Therefore [†](#Dn_CR34) they stood before the king.

**20** [✞] And in every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all [†](#Dn_CR35) the magicians and [†](#Dn_CR36) enchanters that were in all his kingdom.

**21** [✞] And Daniel [†](#Dn_CR37) was there until the first year of [†](#Dn_CR38) King Cyrus.2 [✞] In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; [†](#Dn_CR39) his spirit was troubled, and [†](#Dn_CR40) his sleep left him.

**2** [✞] Then the king commanded that [†](#Dn_CR41) the magicians, [†](#Dn_CR42) the enchanters, the [†](#Dn_CR43) sorcerers, and [†](#Dn_CR44) the Chaldeans be summoned to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and [†](#Dn_CR45) stood before the king.

**3**  And the king said to them, “I had a dream, and [†](#Dn_CR46) my spirit is troubled to know the dream.”

**4** [✞] Then [†](#Dn_CR47) the Chaldeans said to the king in Aramaic, [*](#Dn_NC2) [†](#Dn_CR48) “O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.”

**5** [✞] The king answered and said to [†](#Dn_CR49) the Chaldeans, “The word from me is firm: if you do not make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you shall be [†](#Dn_CR50) torn limb from limb, [†](#Dn_CR50) and your [†](#Dn_CR51) houses shall be laid in ruins.

**6**  But if you show the dream and its interpretation, [†](#Dn_CR52) you shall receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. [†](#Dn_CR53) Therefore show me the dream and its interpretation.”

**7**  They answered a second time and said, “Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show its interpretation.”

**8**  The king answered and said, “I know with certainty that you are trying to [†](#Dn_CR54) gain time, because you see that the word from me is firm—

**9**  if you do not make the dream known to me, [†](#Dn_CR55) there is but one sentence for you. You have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words before me till [†](#Dn_CR56) the times change. [†](#Dn_CR57) Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can show me its interpretation.”

**10**  [†](#Dn_CR58) The Chaldeans answered the king and said, “There is not a man on earth who can meet the king’s demand, for no great and powerful king has asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or [†](#Dn_CR58) Chaldean.

**11** [✞] The thing that the king asks is difficult, and no one can show it to the king except [†](#Dn_CR59) the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.”

**12** [✞] Because of this the king was angry and [†](#Dn_CR60) very furious, and [†](#Dn_CR61) commanded that all [†](#Dn_CR62) the wise men of Babylon be destroyed.

**13**  So the decree went out, and the wise men were about to be killed; and they sought [†](#Dn_CR63) Daniel and his companions, to kill them.

**14**  Then Daniel replied with prudence and discretion to [†](#Dn_CR64) Arioch, the [†](#Dn_CR65) captain of the king’s guard, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon.

**15**  He declared [*](#Dn_NC3) to Arioch, the king’s captain, “Why is the decree of the king [†](#Dn_CR66) so urgent?” Then Arioch made the matter known to Daniel.

**16**  And Daniel went in and requested the king to appoint him a time, that he might show the interpretation to the king.

**17**  Then Daniel went to his house and made the matter known to [†](#Dn_CR67) Hananiah, [†](#Dn_CR67) Mishael, and [†](#Dn_CR67) Azariah, his companions,

**18** [✞] [†](#Dn_CR68) and told them to seek mercy from the [†](#Dn_CR69) God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions might not [†](#Dn_CR70) be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.

**19** [✞] Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in [†](#Dn_CR71) a vision of the night. Then Daniel [†](#Dn_CR72) blessed the [†](#Dn_CR73) God of heaven.

**20** [✞] Daniel answered and said:

> [†](#Dn_CR74) “ Blessed be the name of God forever and ever,

  > [†](#Dn_CR75) to whom belong wisdom and might.

> **21** [✞] [†](#Dn_CR76) He changes times and seasons;

  > [†](#Dn_CR77) he removes kings and sets up kings;

> [†](#Dn_CR78) he gives wisdom to the wise

  > [†](#Dn_CR78) and knowledge to those who have understanding;

> **22** [✞] [†](#Dn_CR79) he reveals deep and hidden things;

  > [†](#Dn_CR79) he knows what is in the darkness,

  > [†](#Dn_CR80) and the light dwells with him.

> **23**  To you, O [†](#Dn_CR81) God of my fathers,

  > [†](#Dn_CR82) I give thanks and praise,

> for [†](#Dn_CR83) you have given me wisdom and might,

  > and have now made known to me what [†](#Dn_CR84) we asked of you,

  > for you have made known to us the king’s matter.”

**24** [✞] Therefore Daniel went in to [†](#Dn_CR85) Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He went and said thus to him: “Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show the king the interpretation.”

**25** [✞] Then [†](#Dn_CR86) Arioch brought in Daniel before the king [†](#Dn_CR87) in haste and said thus to him: “I have found [†](#Dn_CR88) among the exiles from Judah a man who will make known to the king the interpretation.”

**26**  The king declared to Daniel, [†](#Dn_CR89) whose name was Belteshazzar, [†](#Dn_CR90) “Are you able to make known to me the dream that I have seen and its interpretation?”

**27**  Daniel answered the king and said, “No wise men, [†](#Dn_CR91) enchanters, [†](#Dn_CR91) magicians, or [†](#Dn_CR92) astrologers can show to the king the mystery that the king has asked,

**28** [✞] but [†](#Dn_CR93) there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar [†](#Dn_CR94) what will be in the latter days. Your dream and [†](#Dn_CR95) the visions of your head as you lay in bed are these:

**29**  To you, O king, as you lay in bed came thoughts of what would be after this, [†](#Dn_CR96) and he who reveals mysteries made known to you what is to be.

**30**  But [†](#Dn_CR97) as for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because of any wisdom that I have more than all the living, but in order that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that [†](#Dn_CR98) you may know the thoughts of your mind.

**31**  “You saw, O king, and behold, a great image. This image, mighty and of exceeding brightness, stood before you, and its appearance was frightening.

**32** [✞] [†](#Dn_CR99) The head of this image was of fine gold, [†](#Dn_CR100) its chest and arms of silver, its middle and [†](#Dn_CR100) thighs of bronze,

**33** [✞] [†](#Dn_CR101) its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay.

**34** [✞] As you looked, a stone was cut out [†](#Dn_CR102) by no human hand, and it struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and [†](#Dn_CR103) broke them in pieces.

**35**  Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold, all together were broken in pieces, and became [†](#Dn_CR104) like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, so that [†](#Dn_CR105) not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the image became [†](#Dn_CR106) a great mountain [†](#Dn_CR107) and filled the whole earth.

**36**  “This was the dream. Now we will tell the king its interpretation.

**37** [✞] You, O king, [†](#Dn_CR108) the king of kings, to whom [†](#Dn_CR109) the God of heaven [†](#Dn_CR110) has given the kingdom, the power, and the might, and the glory,

**38**  and into whose hand he has given, wherever they dwell, the children of man, [†](#Dn_CR111) the beasts of the field, and the birds of the heavens, making you rule over them all—you are [†](#Dn_CR112) the head of gold.

**39**  [†](#Dn_CR113) Another kingdom inferior to you shall arise after you, and yet a third kingdom [†](#Dn_CR114) of bronze, [†](#Dn_CR115) which shall rule over all the earth.

**40**  And [†](#Dn_CR116) there shall be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron, because iron [†](#Dn_CR117) breaks to pieces and shatters all things. And like iron that crushes, it shall [†](#Dn_CR117) break and crush all these.

**41**  And as you saw [†](#Dn_CR118) the feet and toes, partly of potter’s clay and partly of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom, but some of the [†](#Dn_CR119) firmness of iron shall be in it, just as you saw iron mixed with the soft clay.

**42**  And as the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly brittle.

**43** [✞] As you saw the iron mixed with soft clay, so they will mix with one another in marriage, [*](#Dn_NC4) but they will not hold together, just as iron does not mix with clay.

**44** [✞] And in the days of those kings [†](#Dn_CR120) the God of heaven will set up [†](#Dn_CR121) a kingdom that shall never be destroyed, nor shall the kingdom be left to another people. [†](#Dn_CR122) It shall break in pieces all these kingdoms and bring them to an end, and [†](#Dn_CR121) it shall stand forever,

**45**  just as [†](#Dn_CR123) you saw that [†](#Dn_CR124) a stone was cut from a mountain by no human hand, and that [†](#Dn_CR125) it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold. A [†](#Dn_CR126) great God has made known to the king what shall be after this. The dream is certain, and its interpretation sure.”

**46** [✞] Then King Nebuchadnezzar [†](#Dn_CR127) fell upon his face and [†](#Dn_CR128) paid homage to Daniel, and commanded that [†](#Dn_CR129) an offering and [†](#Dn_CR130) incense be offered up to him.

**47** [✞] The king answered and said to Daniel, “Truly, your [†](#Dn_CR131) God is God of gods and [†](#Dn_CR132) Lord of kings, and [†](#Dn_CR133) a revealer of mysteries, for you have been able to reveal this mystery.”

**48** [✞] Then the king gave Daniel high honors and many great [†](#Dn_CR134) gifts, and made him ruler over the whole [†](#Dn_CR135) province of Babylon and [†](#Dn_CR136) chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.

**49**  Daniel made a request of the king, and he [†](#Dn_CR137) appointed [†](#Dn_CR138) Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of [†](#Dn_CR139) the province of Babylon. But Daniel [†](#Dn_CR140) remained at the king’s court.3 [✞] King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits [*](#Dn_NC5) and its breadth six cubits. He set it up on [†](#Dn_CR141) the plain of Dura, in [†](#Dn_CR142) the province of Babylon.

**2** [✞] Then King Nebuchadnezzar sent to gather [†](#Dn_CR143) the satraps, the prefects, and [†](#Dn_CR144) the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

**3**  Then [†](#Dn_CR145) the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces gathered for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. And they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

**4**  And the herald [†](#Dn_CR146) proclaimed aloud, “You are commanded, O [†](#Dn_CR147) peoples, nations, and languages,

**5** [✞] that when you hear the [†](#Dn_CR148) sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, you [†](#Dn_CR149) are to fall down and worship the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.

**6** [✞] And whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately [†](#Dn_CR150) be cast into a burning fiery furnace.”

**7** [✞] Therefore, as soon as all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, all [†](#Dn_CR151) the peoples, nations, and languages fell down and worshiped the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

**8** [✞] Therefore at that time certain [†](#Dn_CR152) Chaldeans [†](#Dn_CR153) came forward and maliciously accused the Jews.

**9**  They declared [*](#Dn_NC6) to King Nebuchadnezzar, “O king, live forever!

**10**  You, O king, [†](#Dn_CR154) have made a decree, that every man who [†](#Dn_CR155) hears the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, [†](#Dn_CR155) shall fall down and worship the golden image.

**11**  And whoever does not fall down and worship [†](#Dn_CR156) shall be cast into a burning fiery furnace.

**12**  There are certain Jews whom you have [†](#Dn_CR157) appointed over the affairs of [†](#Dn_CR158) the province of Babylon: [†](#Dn_CR159) Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men, O king, [†](#Dn_CR160) pay no attention to you; they do not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up.”

**13**  Then Nebuchadnezzar [†](#Dn_CR161) in furious rage commanded that [†](#Dn_CR162) Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought. So they brought these men before the king.

**14**  Nebuchadnezzar answered and said to them, “Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image that I have set up?

**15** [✞] Now if you are ready when [†](#Dn_CR163) you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, to fall down and worship the image that I have made, well and good. [*](#Dn_NC7) But if you do not worship, [†](#Dn_CR164) you shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace. And [†](#Dn_CR165) who is the god who will deliver you out of my hands?”

**16**  [†](#Dn_CR166) Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.

**17** [✞] If this be so, [†](#Dn_CR167) our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king. [*](#Dn_NC8)

**18** [✞] But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up.”

**19** [✞] Then Nebuchadnezzar was [†](#Dn_CR168) filled with fury, and the expression of his face [†](#Dn_CR169) was changed against [†](#Dn_CR170) Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He ordered the furnace heated seven times more than it was usually heated.

**20**  And he ordered some of the mighty men of his army [†](#Dn_CR171) to bind [†](#Dn_CR172) Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.

**21**  Then these men were [†](#Dn_CR173) bound in their cloaks, their tunics, [*](#Dn_NC9) their hats, and their other garments, and they were thrown into the burning fiery furnace.

**22**  Because the king’s order was [†](#Dn_CR174) urgent and the furnace overheated, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up [†](#Dn_CR175) Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

**23**  And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell [†](#Dn_CR176) bound into the burning fiery furnace.

**24**  Then King Nebuchadnezzar was [†](#Dn_CR177) astonished and rose up [†](#Dn_CR178) in haste. He declared to his [†](#Dn_CR179) counselors, “Did we not cast three men [†](#Dn_CR180) bound into the fire?” They answered and said to the king, “True, O king.”

**25** [✞] He answered and said, “But I see four men unbound, [†](#Dn_CR181) walking in the midst of the fire, and they [†](#Dn_CR182) are not hurt; and the appearance of the fourth is like [†](#Dn_CR183) a son of the gods.”

**26** [✞] Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the door of the burning fiery furnace; he declared, [†](#Dn_CR184) “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the [†](#Dn_CR185) Most High God, come out, and come here!” Then [†](#Dn_CR184) Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out from the fire.

**27**  And the [†](#Dn_CR186) satraps, the prefects, the governors, and [†](#Dn_CR187) the king’s counselors gathered together and saw that [†](#Dn_CR188) the fire had not had any power over the bodies of those men. The hair of their heads was not singed, their [†](#Dn_CR189) cloaks were not harmed, and no smell of fire had come upon them.

**28** [✞] Nebuchadnezzar answered and said, “Blessed be the God of [†](#Dn_CR190) Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who [†](#Dn_CR191) has sent his angel and [†](#Dn_CR192) delivered his servants, who [†](#Dn_CR193) trusted in him, and set aside [*](#Dn_NC10) the king’s command, and yielded up their bodies rather than [†](#Dn_CR194) serve and worship any god except their own God.

**29**  Therefore [†](#Dn_CR195) I make a decree: Any [†](#Dn_CR196) people, nation, or language that speaks anything against the God of [†](#Dn_CR197) Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego [†](#Dn_CR198) shall be torn limb from limb, and their houses laid in ruins, for there is no other god who is able to rescue in this way.”

**30**  Then the king promoted [†](#Dn_CR199) Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in [†](#Dn_CR200) the province of Babylon.4 [✞] [*](#Dn_NC11) King Nebuchadnezzar to all [†](#Dn_CR201) peoples, nations, and languages, [†](#Dn_CR202) that dwell in all the earth: [†](#Dn_CR203) Peace be multiplied to you!

**2** [✞] It has seemed good to me to show the [†](#Dn_CR204) signs and wonders that the [†](#Dn_CR205) Most High God has done for me.

> **3** [✞] How great are [†](#Dn_CR206) his signs,

  > how mighty his [†](#Dn_CR206) wonders!

> [†](#Dn_CR207) His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,

  > [†](#Dn_CR207) and his dominion endures from generation to generation.

**4**  [*](#Dn_NC12) I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house and prospering in my palace.

**5**  I saw a dream that made me afraid. As I lay in bed the fancies and [†](#Dn_CR208) the visions of my head alarmed me.

**6** [✞] So [†](#Dn_CR209) I made a decree that [†](#Dn_CR210) all the wise men of Babylon should be brought before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.

**7** [✞] Then [†](#Dn_CR211) the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers came in, and I told them the dream, but [†](#Dn_CR212) they could not make known to me its interpretation.

**8** [✞] At last Daniel came in before me—he who was named [†](#Dn_CR213) Belteshazzar after the name of my god, and in whom is [†](#Dn_CR214) the spirit of the holy gods [*](#Dn_NC13)—and I told him the dream, saying,

**9**  “O Belteshazzar, [†](#Dn_CR215) chief of the magicians, because I know that [†](#Dn_CR216) the spirit of the holy gods is in you and that no [†](#Dn_CR217) mystery is too difficult for you, tell me [†](#Dn_CR218) the visions of my dream that I saw and their interpretation.

**10** [✞] [†](#Dn_CR219) The visions of my head as I lay in bed were these: I saw, and [†](#Dn_CR220) behold, a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great.

**11** [✞] [†](#Dn_CR221) The tree grew and became strong, and its top reached to heaven, and it was visible to the end of the whole earth.

**12**  [†](#Dn_CR222) Its leaves were beautiful and its fruit abundant, and in it was food for all. [†](#Dn_CR223) The beasts of the field found shade under it, and [†](#Dn_CR223) the birds of the heavens lived in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it.

**13** [✞] “I saw in [†](#Dn_CR224) the visions of my head as I lay in bed, and behold, [†](#Dn_CR225) a watcher, [†](#Dn_CR226) a holy one, came down from heaven.

**14**  He [†](#Dn_CR227) proclaimed aloud and said thus: [†](#Dn_CR228) ‘Chop down the tree and [†](#Dn_CR229) lop off its branches, [†](#Dn_CR229) strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. [†](#Dn_CR229) Let the beasts flee from under it and the birds from its branches.

**15** [✞] But leave the stump of its roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze, amid the tender grass of the field. Let him be wet with the dew of heaven. Let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth.

**16** [✞] Let his mind be changed from a man’s, and let a beast’s mind be given to him; [†](#Dn_CR230) and let seven periods of time [†](#Dn_CR231) pass over him.

**17**  The sentence is by the decree of [†](#Dn_CR232) the watchers, the decision by the word of [†](#Dn_CR233) the holy ones, to the end that the living may know that the Most High [†](#Dn_CR234) rules the kingdom of men [†](#Dn_CR235) and gives it to whom he will and [†](#Dn_CR236) sets over it the lowliest of men.’

**18**  This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw. And you, O [†](#Dn_CR237) Belteshazzar, tell me the interpretation, because [†](#Dn_CR238) all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation, but you are able, for [†](#Dn_CR239) the spirit of the holy gods is in you.”

**19**  Then Daniel, whose name was [†](#Dn_CR240) Belteshazzar, was [†](#Dn_CR241) dismayed for a while, and [†](#Dn_CR242) his thoughts alarmed him. The king answered and said, “Belteshazzar, let not the dream or the interpretation alarm you.” Belteshazzar answered and said, “My lord, [†](#Dn_CR243) may the dream be for those who hate you [†](#Dn_CR243) and its interpretation for your enemies!

**20**  [†](#Dn_CR244) The tree you saw, which grew and became strong, so that its top reached to heaven, and it was visible to the end of the whole earth,

**21**  [†](#Dn_CR245) whose leaves were beautiful and its fruit abundant, and in which was food for all, under which beasts of the field found shade, and in whose branches the birds of the heavens lived—

**22** [✞] [†](#Dn_CR246) it is you, O king, who have grown and become strong. [†](#Dn_CR247) Your greatness has grown and reaches to heaven, [†](#Dn_CR247) and your dominion to the ends of the earth.

**23**  And because the king saw [†](#Dn_CR248) a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, [†](#Dn_CR249) ‘Chop down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump of its roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field, and let him be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till [†](#Dn_CR250) seven periods of time pass over him,’

**24**  this is the interpretation, O king: It is a decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king,

**25** [✞] [†](#Dn_CR251) that you shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. You shall be made [†](#Dn_CR252) to eat grass like an ox, and you shall be wet with the dew of heaven, and [†](#Dn_CR253) seven periods of time shall pass over you, till [†](#Dn_CR254) you know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will.

**26** [✞] And as it was commanded [†](#Dn_CR255) to leave the stump of the roots of the tree, your kingdom shall be confirmed for you from the time that you know that Heaven rules.

**27** [✞] Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you: break off your sins by [†](#Dn_CR256) practicing righteousness, [†](#Dn_CR257) and your iniquities by showing mercy to the oppressed, [†](#Dn_CR258) that there may perhaps be a lengthening of your prosperity.”

**28**  All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar.

**29** [✞] At the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon,

**30**  and the king answered and said, [†](#Dn_CR259) “Is not this great Babylon, which I have built by [†](#Dn_CR260) my mighty power as a royal residence and for [†](#Dn_CR260) the glory of my majesty?”

**31**  [†](#Dn_CR261) While the words were still in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, “O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: The kingdom has departed from you,

**32**  [†](#Dn_CR262) and you shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. And you shall be made to eat grass like an ox, and seven periods of time shall pass over you, [†](#Dn_CR263) until you know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will.”

**33**  Immediately the word was fulfilled against Nebuchadnezzar. [†](#Dn_CR263) He was driven from among men and ate grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hair grew as long as eagles’ feathers, and his nails were like birds’ claws.

**34** [✞] [†](#Dn_CR264) At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven, and [†](#Dn_CR265) my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and praised and honored [†](#Dn_CR266) him who lives forever,

> [†](#Dn_CR267) for his dominion is an everlasting dominion,

  > and [†](#Dn_CR267) his kingdom endures from generation to generation;

> **35** [✞] [†](#Dn_CR268) all the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing,

  > and [†](#Dn_CR269) he does according to his will among the host of heaven

  > and among the inhabitants of the earth;

> [†](#Dn_CR270) and none can stay his hand

  > or [†](#Dn_CR271) say to him, “What have you done?”

5 [✞] [†](#Dn_CR281) King Belshazzar [†](#Dn_CR282) made a great feast for a thousand of his [†](#Dn_CR283) lords and drank wine in front of the thousand.

**2** [✞] [†](#Dn_CR284) Belshazzar, when he tasted the wine, commanded that [†](#Dn_CR285) the vessels of gold and of silver that Nebuchadnezzar his father [*](#Dn_NC14) had taken out of the temple in Jerusalem be brought, that the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines might drink from them.

**3**  Then they brought in [†](#Dn_CR286) the golden vessels that had been taken out of the temple, the house of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines drank from them.

**4** [✞] They drank wine and [†](#Dn_CR287) praised the [†](#Dn_CR288) gods of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.

**5** [✞] [†](#Dn_CR289) Immediately [†](#Dn_CR290) the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace, opposite the lampstand. And the king saw [†](#Dn_CR291) the hand as it wrote.

**6** [✞] [†](#Dn_CR292) Then the king’s color changed, [†](#Dn_CR293) and his thoughts alarmed him; [†](#Dn_CR294) his limbs gave way, and [†](#Dn_CR295) his knees knocked together.

**7** [✞] [†](#Dn_CR296) The king called loudly to bring in [†](#Dn_CR296) the enchanters, the [†](#Dn_CR297) Chaldeans, and [†](#Dn_CR298) the astrologers. The king declared [*](#Dn_NC15) to the wise men of Babylon, [†](#Dn_CR299) “Whoever reads this writing, and shows me its interpretation, shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold around his neck and [†](#Dn_CR300) shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.”

**8**  Then all the king’s wise men came in, but [†](#Dn_CR301) they could not read the writing or make known to the king the interpretation.

**9**  Then King Belshazzar was greatly [†](#Dn_CR302) alarmed, and his [†](#Dn_CR303) color changed, and his [†](#Dn_CR304) lords were perplexed.

**10** [✞] The queen, [*](#Dn_NC16) because of the words of the king and his lords, came into the banqueting hall, and the queen declared, [†](#Dn_CR305) “O king, live forever! Let not your thoughts alarm you [†](#Dn_CR306) or your color change.

**11** [✞] There is a man in your kingdom [†](#Dn_CR307) in whom is the spirit of the holy gods. [*](#Dn_NC17) In the days of your father, [†](#Dn_CR308) light and understanding and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods were found in him, and King Nebuchadnezzar, your father—your father the king—[†](#Dn_CR309) made him chief of the magicians, [†](#Dn_CR310) enchanters, Chaldeans, and astrologers,

**12** [✞] [†](#Dn_CR311) because an excellent spirit, knowledge, and [†](#Dn_CR312) understanding [†](#Dn_CR312) to interpret dreams, explain riddles, and [†](#Dn_CR313) solve problems were found in this Daniel, [†](#Dn_CR314) whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.”

**13** [✞] Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king answered and said to Daniel, “You are that Daniel, one of [†](#Dn_CR315) the exiles of Judah, whom the king my father brought from Judah.

**14**  I have heard of you that [†](#Dn_CR316) the spirit of the gods [*](#Dn_NC18) is in you, and that [†](#Dn_CR317) light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you.

**15**  Now [†](#Dn_CR318) the wise men, the [†](#Dn_CR319) enchanters, have been brought in before me to read this writing and make known to me its interpretation, but [†](#Dn_CR320) they could not show the interpretation of the matter.

**16** [✞] [†](#Dn_CR321) But I have heard that you can give interpretations and [†](#Dn_CR322) solve problems. [†](#Dn_CR323) Now if you can read the writing and make known to me its interpretation, [†](#Dn_CR323) you shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold around your neck and [†](#Dn_CR324) shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.”

**17** [✞] Then Daniel answered and said before the king, [†](#Dn_CR325) “Let your gifts be for yourself, and give your rewards to another. Nevertheless, I will read the writing to the king and make known to him the interpretation.

**18** [✞] O king, the [†](#Dn_CR326) Most High God [†](#Dn_CR327) gave [†](#Dn_CR328) Nebuchadnezzar your father [†](#Dn_CR329) kingship and greatness and glory and majesty.

**19**  And because of the greatness that he gave him, [†](#Dn_CR330) all peoples, nations, and languages [†](#Dn_CR331) trembled and feared before him. Whom he would, he killed, and whom he would, he kept alive; whom he would, he raised up, and whom he would, he humbled.

**20**  But [†](#Dn_CR332) when his heart was lifted up and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, [†](#Dn_CR333) he was brought down from his kingly throne, and his glory was taken from him.

**21** [✞] [†](#Dn_CR334) He was driven from among the children of mankind, and his mind was made like that of a beast, and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys. He was fed grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, [†](#Dn_CR334) until he knew that the [†](#Dn_CR335) Most High God rules the kingdom of mankind and sets over it whom he will.

**22** [✞] And you his son, [*](#Dn_NC19) [†](#Dn_CR336) Belshazzar, [†](#Dn_CR337) have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this,

**23**  but you have lifted up yourself against [†](#Dn_CR338) the Lord of heaven. And [†](#Dn_CR339) the vessels of his house have been brought in before you, and you and your lords, your wives, and your concubines have drunk wine from them. [†](#Dn_CR340) And you have praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which do not see or hear or know, [†](#Dn_CR341) but the God in whose hand is your breath, and [†](#Dn_CR342) whose are all your ways, [†](#Dn_CR343) you have not honored.

**24** [✞] “Then from his presence [†](#Dn_CR344) the hand was sent, and this writing was inscribed.

**25** [✞] And this is the writing that was inscribed: **MENE**, **MENE**, **TEKEL**, and **PARSIN**.

**26** [✞] This is the interpretation of the matter: **MENE**, God has numbered [*](#Dn_NC20) the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end;

**27** [✞] **TEKEL**, [†](#Dn_CR345) you have been weighed [*](#Dn_NC21) in the balances and found wanting;

**28** [✞] **PERES**, your kingdom is divided and given to [†](#Dn_CR346) the Medes and [†](#Dn_CR347) Persians.” [*](#Dn_NC22)

**29** [✞] Then [†](#Dn_CR348) Belshazzar gave the command, and Daniel [†](#Dn_CR349) was clothed with purple, a chain of gold was put around his neck, and a proclamation was made about him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.

**30** [✞] [†](#Dn_CR350) That very night [†](#Dn_CR351) Belshazzar the [†](#Dn_CR352) Chaldean king was killed.

**31** [✞] [*](#Dn_NC23) And [†](#Dn_CR353) Darius [†](#Dn_CR354) the Mede received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old.6 [✞] It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom [†](#Dn_CR355) 120 [†](#Dn_CR356) satraps, to be throughout the whole kingdom;

**2**  and over them [†](#Dn_CR357) three high officials, of whom Daniel was one, to whom these [†](#Dn_CR358) satraps should give account, so that the king might suffer no loss.

**3** [✞] Then this Daniel became [†](#Dn_CR359) distinguished above all [†](#Dn_CR360) the other high officials and [†](#Dn_CR361) satraps, because [†](#Dn_CR362) an excellent spirit was in him. And the king planned [†](#Dn_CR363) to set him over the whole kingdom.

**4**  Then [†](#Dn_CR364) the high officials and [†](#Dn_CR365) the satraps [†](#Dn_CR366) sought to find a ground for complaint against Daniel with regard to the kingdom, [†](#Dn_CR367) but they could find no ground for complaint or any fault, because he was faithful, [†](#Dn_CR367) and no error or fault was found in him.

**5** [✞] Then these men said, “We shall not find any ground for complaint against this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God.”

**6**  Then these [†](#Dn_CR368) high officials and [†](#Dn_CR369) satraps came by agreement [*](#Dn_NC24) to the king and said to him, “O [†](#Dn_CR370) King Darius, live forever!

**7** [✞] All the [†](#Dn_CR371) high officials of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the [†](#Dn_CR372) counselors and the governors are agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce an [†](#Dn_CR373) injunction, that whoever makes petition to any god or man for thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions.

**8** [✞] Now, O king, establish [†](#Dn_CR374) the injunction and sign the document, so that it cannot be changed, according to [†](#Dn_CR375) the law of [†](#Dn_CR376) the Medes and the Persians, [†](#Dn_CR377) which cannot be revoked.”

**9**  Therefore King Darius signed the document and [†](#Dn_CR378) injunction.

**10** [✞] When Daniel knew that the document had been signed, he went to his house where [†](#Dn_CR379) he had windows in his upper chamber open [†](#Dn_CR380) toward Jerusalem. He got down on his knees [†](#Dn_CR381) three times a day and prayed and [†](#Dn_CR382) gave thanks before his God, as he had done previously.

**11**  Then these men came by agreement and found Daniel making petition and plea before his God.

**12** [✞] Then they [†](#Dn_CR383) came near and said before the king, concerning the injunction, “O king! Did you not sign [†](#Dn_CR384) an injunction, that anyone who makes petition to any god or man within thirty days except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?” The king answered and said, “The thing stands fast, according to the law of [†](#Dn_CR385) the Medes and Persians, [†](#Dn_CR386) which cannot be revoked.”

**13** [✞] Then they answered and said before the king, [†](#Dn_CR387) “Daniel, who is one [†](#Dn_CR388) of the exiles [†](#Dn_CR387) from Judah, [†](#Dn_CR389) pays no attention to you, O king, or [†](#Dn_CR390) the injunction you have signed, but makes his petition [†](#Dn_CR391) three times a day.”

**14** [✞] Then [†](#Dn_CR392) the king, when he heard these words, [†](#Dn_CR392) was much distressed and set his mind to deliver Daniel. And he labored till the sun went down to rescue him.

**15**  Then these men came by agreement to the king and said to the king, “Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no [†](#Dn_CR393) injunction or ordinance that the king establishes can be changed.”

**16** [✞] Then the king commanded, and Daniel was brought and cast into the den of lions. The king declared [*](#Dn_NC25) to Daniel, “May [†](#Dn_CR394) your God, whom you serve continually, deliver you!”

**17** [✞] [†](#Dn_CR395) And a stone was brought and laid on the mouth of the den, [†](#Dn_CR396) and the king sealed it [†](#Dn_CR397) with his own signet and with the signet of his [†](#Dn_CR398) lords, that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.

**18**  Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting; [†](#Dn_CR399) no diversions were brought to him, and [†](#Dn_CR400) sleep fled from him.

**19** [✞] Then, at break of day, the king arose and went in haste to the den of lions.

**20**  As he came near to the den where Daniel was, he cried out in a tone of anguish. The king declared to Daniel, “O Daniel, servant of [†](#Dn_CR401) the living God, [†](#Dn_CR402) has your God, whom you serve continually, [†](#Dn_CR403) been able to deliver you from the lions?”

**21**  Then Daniel said to the king, [†](#Dn_CR404) “O king, live forever!

**22** [✞] My God [†](#Dn_CR405) sent his angel [†](#Dn_CR406) and shut the lions’ mouths, and they have not harmed me, because I was found blameless [†](#Dn_CR407) before him; [†](#Dn_CR407) and also before you, O king, I have done no harm.”

**23** [✞] Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that Daniel be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and [†](#Dn_CR408) no kind of harm was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.

**24** [✞] And the king commanded, and [†](#Dn_CR409) those men who had maliciously accused Daniel were brought and cast into the den of lions—they, their children, and their wives. And before they reached the bottom of the den, the lions overpowered them and broke all their bones in pieces.

**25**  Then King Darius wrote to all [†](#Dn_CR410) the peoples, nations, and languages [†](#Dn_CR411) that dwell in all the earth: [†](#Dn_CR412) “Peace be multiplied to you.

**26** [✞] [†](#Dn_CR413) I make a decree, that in all my royal dominion [†](#Dn_CR414) people are to tremble and fear before the God of Daniel,

> for [†](#Dn_CR415) he is [†](#Dn_CR416) the living God,

  > enduring forever;

> his kingdom shall never be destroyed,

  > [†](#Dn_CR416) and his dominion shall be [†](#Dn_CR417) to the end.

> **27**  He delivers and rescues;

  > he works [†](#Dn_CR418) signs and wonders

  > in heaven and on earth,

> he who has [†](#Dn_CR419) saved Daniel

  > from the power of the lions.”

**28** [✞] So this Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and [†](#Dn_CR420) the reign of [†](#Dn_CR421) Cyrus the Persian.
