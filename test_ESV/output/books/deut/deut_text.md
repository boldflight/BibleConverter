### The Command to Leave Horeb

1 [✞] These are the words that Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in [†](#Dt_CR1) the Arabah opposite [†](#Dt_CR2) Suph, between [†](#Dt_CR3) Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab.

**2** [✞] It is eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to [†](#Dt_CR4) Kadesh-barnea.

**3** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR5) In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke to the people of Israel according to all that the L**ORD** had given him in commandment to them,

**4** [✞] after [†](#Dt_CR6) he had defeated Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and [†](#Dt_CR7) Og the king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth and in [†](#Dt_CR8) Edrei.

**5** [✞] Beyond the Jordan, [†](#Dt_CR9) in the land of Moab, Moses undertook to explain this law, saying,

**6** [✞] “The L**ORD** our God said to us in Horeb, [†](#Dt_CR10) ‘You have stayed long enough at this mountain.

**7** [✞] Turn and take your journey, and go to [†](#Dt_CR11) the hill country of the Amorites and to all their neighbors in [†](#Dt_CR12) the Arabah, [†](#Dt_CR13) in the hill country and in the lowland and in the Negeb and [†](#Dt_CR13) by the seacoast, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.

**8** [✞] See, I have set the land before you. Go in and take possession of the land that the L**ORD** swore to your fathers, [†](#Dt_CR14) to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to their offspring after them.’

**9**  “At that time [†](#Dt_CR15) I said to you, ‘I am not able to bear you by myself.

**10**  The L**ORD** your God has multiplied you, and behold, [†](#Dt_CR16) you are today as numerous as the stars of heaven.

**11**  [†](#Dt_CR17) May the L**ORD**, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as you are and bless you, [†](#Dt_CR18) as he has promised you!

**12**  [†](#Dt_CR19) How can I bear by myself the weight and burden of you and your strife?

**13** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR20) Choose for your tribes wise, understanding, and experienced men, and I will appoint them as your heads.’

**14**  And you answered me, ‘The thing that you have spoken is good for us to do.’

**15**  So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and experienced men, [†](#Dt_CR21) and set them as heads over you, commanders of thousands, commanders of hundreds, commanders of fifties, commanders of tens, and officers, throughout your tribes.

**16**  And I charged your judges at that time, ‘Hear the cases between your brothers, and [†](#Dt_CR22) judge righteously between a man and his brother or the alien who is with him.

**17**  [†](#Dt_CR23) You shall not be partial in judgment. You shall hear the small and the great alike. You shall not be intimidated by anyone, for [†](#Dt_CR24) the judgment is God’s. And the case that is too hard for you, you shall [†](#Dt_CR25) bring to me, and I will hear it.’

**18**  And I commanded you at that time all the things that you should do.

**19** [✞] “Then we set out from Horeb and [†](#Dt_CR26) went through all that great and terrifying wilderness that you saw, on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as the L**ORD** our God commanded us. And [†](#Dt_CR27) we came to Kadesh-barnea.

**20**  And I said to you, ‘You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which the L**ORD** our God is giving us.

**21**  See, the L**ORD** your God has set the land before you. Go up, take possession, as the L**ORD**, the God of your fathers, has told you. [†](#Dt_CR28) Do not fear or be dismayed.’

**22**  Then all of you came near me and said, ‘Let us send men before us, that they may explore the land for us and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up and the cities into which we shall come.’

**23**  The thing seemed good to me, and [†](#Dt_CR29) I took twelve men from you, one man from each tribe.

**24**  And [†](#Dt_CR30) they turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshcol and spied it out.

**25**  And they took in their hands some of the fruit of the land and brought it down to us, and brought us word again and said, ‘It is a good land that the L**ORD** our God is giving us.’

**26** [✞] “Yet you would not go up, but rebelled against the command of the L**ORD** your God.

**27**  And [†](#Dt_CR31) you murmured in your tents and said, ‘Because the L**ORD** [†](#Dt_CR32) hated us he has brought us out of the land of Egypt, [†](#Dt_CR33) to give us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.

**28** [✞] Where are we going up? [†](#Dt_CR34) Our brothers have made our hearts melt, saying, [†](#Dt_CR35) “The people are greater and taller than we. The cities are great and fortified up to heaven. And besides, we have seen [†](#Dt_CR36) the sons of the Anakim there.”’

**29**  Then I said to you, ‘Do not be in dread or afraid of them.

**30**  The L**ORD** your God who goes before you [†](#Dt_CR37) will himself fight for you, just as he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,

**31**  and in the wilderness, where you have seen how the L**ORD** your God [†](#Dt_CR38) carried you, as a man carries his son, all the way that you went until you came to this place.’

**32**  Yet in spite of this word [†](#Dt_CR39) you did not believe the L**ORD** your God,

**33** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR40) who went before you in the way [†](#Dt_CR41) to seek you out a place to pitch your tents, in fire by night and in the cloud by day, to show you by what way you should go.

**34**  “And the L**ORD** heard your words and was angered, and he swore,

**35**  [†](#Dt_CR42) ‘Not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land that I swore to give to your fathers,

**36**  [†](#Dt_CR43) except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He shall see it, and to him and to his children I will give the land on which he has trodden, because he has wholly followed the L**ORD**!’

**37** [✞] Even with me [†](#Dt_CR44) the L**ORD** was angry on your account and said, ‘You also shall not go in there.

**38**  [†](#Dt_CR45) Joshua the son of Nun, [†](#Dt_CR45) who stands before you, he shall enter. [†](#Dt_CR46) Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.

**39**  And as for [†](#Dt_CR47) your little ones, who you said would become a prey, and your children, who today [†](#Dt_CR48) have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in there. And to them I will give it, and they shall possess it.

**40**  But as for you, [†](#Dt_CR49) turn, and journey into the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea.’

**41**  “Then you answered me, [†](#Dt_CR50) ‘We have sinned against the L**ORD**. We ourselves will go up and fight, just as the L**ORD** our God commanded us.’ And every one of you fastened on his weapons of war and thought it easy to go up into the hill country.

**42**  And the L**ORD** said to me, [†](#Dt_CR51) ‘Say to them, Do not go up or fight, [†](#Dt_CR52) for I am not in your midst, lest you be defeated before your enemies.’

**43**  So I spoke to you, and you would not listen; but you rebelled against the command of the L**ORD** and [†](#Dt_CR53) presumptuously went up into the hill country.

**44**  [†](#Dt_CR54) Then the Amorites who lived in that hill country came out against you and chased you [†](#Dt_CR55) as bees do and beat you down in Seir as far as [†](#Dt_CR56) Hormah.

**45**  And you returned and wept before the L**ORD**, but the L**ORD** did not listen to your voice or give ear to you.

**46** [✞] So [†](#Dt_CR57) you remained at Kadesh many days, the days that you remained there.2 [✞] “Then we turned and journeyed into the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea, [†](#Dt_CR58) as the L**ORD** told me. And for many days we traveled around Mount Seir.

**2**  Then the L**ORD** said to me,

**3**  ‘You have been traveling around this mountain country [†](#Dt_CR59) long enough. Turn northward

**4** [✞] and command the people, “You are about to pass through the territory of [†](#Dt_CR60) your brothers, the people of Esau, [†](#Dt_CR61) who live in Seir; and [†](#Dt_CR62) they will be afraid of you. So be very careful.

**5**  Do not contend with them, for I will not give you any of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on, because [†](#Dt_CR63) I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession.

**6**  [†](#Dt_CR64) You shall purchase food from them with money, that you may eat, and you shall also buy water from them with money, that you may drink.

**7**  For the L**ORD** your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. [†](#Dt_CR65) He knows your going through this great wilderness. [†](#Dt_CR66) These forty years the L**ORD** your God has been with you. You have lacked nothing.”’

**8** [✞] So [†](#Dt_CR67) we went on, away from our brothers, the people of Esau, who live in Seir, away from [†](#Dt_CR68) the Arabah road from [†](#Dt_CR69) Elath and [†](#Dt_CR70) Ezion-geber.“And we turned and went in the direction of the wilderness of Moab.

**9**  And the L**ORD** said to me, [†](#Dt_CR71) ‘Do not harass Moab or contend with them in battle, for I will not give you any of their land for a possession, because I have given [†](#Dt_CR72) Ar to [†](#Dt_CR73) the people of Lot for a possession.’

**10** [✞] ([†](#Dt_CR74) The Emim formerly lived there, [†](#Dt_CR75) a people great and many, and tall [†](#Dt_CR76) as the Anakim.

**11**  Like the Anakim they are also counted as [†](#Dt_CR77) Rephaim, but the Moabites call them Emim.

**12** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR78) The Horites also lived in Seir formerly, but the people of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them and settled in their place, [†](#Dt_CR79) as Israel did to the land of their possession, which the L**ORD** gave to them.)

**13**  ‘Now rise up and go over [†](#Dt_CR80) the brook Zered.’ So we went over [†](#Dt_CR80) the brook Zered.

**14** [✞] And the time from our leaving [†](#Dt_CR81) Kadesh-barnea until we crossed [†](#Dt_CR82) the brook Zered was thirty-eight years, [†](#Dt_CR83) until the entire generation, that is, the men of war, had perished from the camp, as the L**ORD** had sworn to them.

**15**  For indeed the hand of the L**ORD** was against them, to destroy them from the camp, until they had perished.

**16**  “So as soon as all the men of war had perished and were dead from among the people,

**17**  the L**ORD** said to me,

**18**  ‘Today you are to cross the border of Moab at Ar.

**19** [✞] And when you approach the territory of the people of Ammon, [†](#Dt_CR84) do not harass them or contend with them, for I will not give you any of the land of the people of Ammon as a possession, because I have given it to [†](#Dt_CR85) the sons of Lot for a possession.’

**20**  (It is also counted as a land of [†](#Dt_CR86) Rephaim. Rephaim formerly lived there—but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim—

**21**  [†](#Dt_CR87) a people great and many, and tall as the Anakim; but the L**ORD** destroyed them before the Ammonites, [*](#Dt_NB1) and they dispossessed them and settled in their place,

**22**  as he did for the people of Esau, who live in Seir, when he destroyed [†](#Dt_CR88) the Horites before them and they dispossessed them and settled in their place even to this day.

**23** [✞] As for [†](#Dt_CR89) the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as [†](#Dt_CR90) Gaza, [†](#Dt_CR91) the Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and settled in their place.)

**24**  ‘Rise up, set out on your journey and [†](#Dt_CR92) go over the Valley of the Arnon. Behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of [†](#Dt_CR93) Heshbon, and his land. Begin to take possession, and [†](#Dt_CR94) contend with him in battle.

**25** [✞] This day I will begin to put [†](#Dt_CR95) the dread and fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of you and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.’

**26**  “So I sent messengers from the wilderness of [†](#Dt_CR96) Kedemoth to Sihon the king of [†](#Dt_CR97) Heshbon, [†](#Dt_CR98) with words of peace, saying,

**27** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR99) ‘Let me pass through your land. I will go only by the road; I will turn aside neither to the right nor to the left.

**28**  [†](#Dt_CR100) You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat, and give me water for money, that I may drink. Only let me pass through on foot,

**29**  [†](#Dt_CR101) as the sons of Esau who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for me, until I go over the Jordan into the land that the L**ORD** our God is giving to us.’

**30**  But [†](#Dt_CR102) Sihon the king of [†](#Dt_CR103) Heshbon would not let us pass by him, for the L**ORD** your God [†](#Dt_CR104) hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, that he might give him into your hand, as he is this day.

**31**  And the L**ORD** said to me, ‘Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land over to you. Begin to take possession, that you may occupy his land.’

**32** [✞] Then [†](#Dt_CR105) Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz.

**33**  And [†](#Dt_CR106) the L**ORD** our God gave him over to us, and [†](#Dt_CR107) we defeated him and his sons and all his people.

**34**  And we captured all his cities at that time and devoted to destruction [*](#Dt_NB2) every [†](#Dt_CR108) city, men, women, and children. We left no survivors.

**35**  Only the livestock we took as spoil for ourselves, with the plunder of the cities that we captured.

**36**  [†](#Dt_CR109) From Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and from [†](#Dt_CR110) the city that is in the valley, as far as Gilead, there was not a city too high for us. [†](#Dt_CR111) The L**ORD** our God gave all into our hands.

**37**  Only to the land of the sons of Ammon you did not draw near, that is, to all the banks of the river [†](#Dt_CR112) Jabbok and the cities of the hill country, whatever the L**ORD** our God had forbidden us.3 [✞] “Then we turned and went up the way to Bashan. And [†](#Dt_CR113) Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at [†](#Dt_CR114) Edrei.

**2**  But the L**ORD** said to me, ‘Do not fear him, for I have given him and all his people and his land into your hand. And you shall do to him as you did to [†](#Dt_CR115) Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.’

**3**  So the L**ORD** our God gave into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people, [†](#Dt_CR116) and we struck him down until he had no survivor left.

**4**  And we took all his cities at that time—there was not a city that we did not take from them—sixty cities, [†](#Dt_CR117) the whole region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

**5**  All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, besides very many unwalled villages.

**6**  And [†](#Dt_CR118) we devoted them to destruction, [*](#Dt_NB3) as we did to Sihon the king of Heshbon, devoting to destruction every [†](#Dt_CR119) city, men, women, and children.

**7**  But all the livestock and the spoil of the cities we took as our plunder.

**8** [✞] So we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the Valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon

**9** [✞] (the Sidonians call [†](#Dt_CR120) Hermon [†](#Dt_CR121) Sirion, while the Amorites call it [†](#Dt_CR122) Senir),

**10**  all the cities of the [†](#Dt_CR123) tableland and all Gilead and all Bashan, as far as [†](#Dt_CR124) Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

**11** [✞] (For [†](#Dt_CR125) only Og the king of Bashan was left of the remnant of [†](#Dt_CR126) the Rephaim. Behold, his bed was a bed of iron. Is it not in [†](#Dt_CR127) Rabbah of the Ammonites? Nine cubits [*](#Dt_NB4) was its length, and four cubits its breadth, according to the [†](#Dt_CR128) common cubit. [*](#Dt_NB5))

**12** [✞] “When we took possession of this land at that time, I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory beginning [†](#Dt_CR129) at Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead with [†](#Dt_CR130) its cities.

**13** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR131) The rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, that is, [†](#Dt_CR132) all the region of Argob, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (All that portion of Bashan is called the land of [†](#Dt_CR133) Rephaim.

**14** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR134) Jair the Manassite took all the region of Argob, that is, Bashan, as far as the border of [†](#Dt_CR135) the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called the villages [†](#Dt_CR136) after his own name, Havvoth-jair, as it is to this day.)

**15**  To Machir [†](#Dt_CR137) I gave Gilead,

**16**  and to the Reubenites [†](#Dt_CR138) and the Gadites I gave the territory from Gilead as far as the Valley of the Arnon, with the middle of the valley as a border, as far over as the river Jabbok, [†](#Dt_CR139) the border of the Ammonites;

**17**  the Arabah also, with the Jordan as the border, from [†](#Dt_CR140) Chinnereth as far as [†](#Dt_CR141) the Sea of the Arabah, [†](#Dt_CR142) the Salt Sea, under [†](#Dt_CR143) the slopes of Pisgah on the east.

**18** [✞] “And I commanded you at that time, saying, ‘The L**ORD** your God has given you this land to possess. [†](#Dt_CR144) All your men of valor shall cross over armed before your brothers, the people of Israel.

**19**  Only your wives, your little ones, and your livestock [†](#Dt_CR145) (I know that you have much livestock) shall remain in the cities that I have given you,

**20**  [†](#Dt_CR146) until the L**ORD** gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also occupy the land that the L**ORD** your God gives them beyond the Jordan. Then each of you may return to his possession which I have given you.’

**21**  And I commanded [†](#Dt_CR147) Joshua at that time, ‘Your eyes have seen all that the L**ORD** your God has done to these two kings. So will the L**ORD** do to all the kingdoms into which you are crossing.

**22** [✞] You shall not fear them, for it is [†](#Dt_CR148) the L**ORD** your God who fights for you.’

**23** [✞] “And I pleaded with the L**ORD** at that time, saying,

**24**  ‘O Lord G**OD**, you have only begun to show your servant [†](#Dt_CR149) your greatness and your mighty hand. For [†](#Dt_CR150) what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do such works and mighty acts as yours?

**25**  Please let me go over and see [†](#Dt_CR151) the good land beyond the Jordan, that good hill country and [†](#Dt_CR152) Lebanon.’

**26**  But [†](#Dt_CR153) the L**ORD** was angry with me because of you and would not listen to me. And the L**ORD** said to me, [†](#Dt_CR154) ‘Enough from you; do not speak to me of this matter again.

**27**  [†](#Dt_CR155) Go up to the top of Pisgah and lift up your eyes westward and northward and southward and eastward, and look at it with your eyes, for you shall not go over this Jordan.

**28**  But [†](#Dt_CR156) charge Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, for he shall go over at the head of this people, and he shall put them in possession of the land that you shall see.’

**29** [✞] So we remained in [†](#Dt_CR157) the valley opposite Beth-peor.4 [✞] “And now, O Israel, listen to [†](#Dt_CR158) the statutes and the rules [*](#Dt_NB6) that I am teaching you, and do them, [†](#Dt_CR159) that you may live, and go in and take possession of the land that the L**ORD**, the God of your fathers, is giving you.

**2** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR160) You shall not add to the word that I command you, nor take from it, that you may keep the commandments of the L**ORD** your God that I command you.

**3** [✞] Your eyes have seen what the L**ORD** did [†](#Dt_CR161) at Baal-peor, for the L**ORD** your God destroyed from among you all the men who followed the Baal of Peor.

**4**  But you who held fast to the L**ORD** your God are all alive today.

**5**  See, I have taught you statutes and rules, as the L**ORD** my God commanded me, that you should do them in the land that you are entering to take possession of it.

**6** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR162) Keep them and do them, for [†](#Dt_CR163) that will be your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, who, when they hear all these statutes, will say, ‘Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.’

**7**  For [†](#Dt_CR164) what great nation is there that has [†](#Dt_CR165) a god so near to it as the L**ORD** our God is to us, whenever we call upon him?

**8**  And what great nation is there, that has statutes and rules so [†](#Dt_CR166) righteous as all this law that I set before you today?

**9** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR167) “Only take care, and [†](#Dt_CR168) keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things that your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life. [†](#Dt_CR169) Make them known to your children and your children’s children—

**10** [✞] how on [†](#Dt_CR170) the day that you stood before the L**ORD** your God at Horeb, the L**ORD** said to me, [†](#Dt_CR171) ‘Gather the people to me, that I may let them hear my words, [†](#Dt_CR172) so that they may learn to fear [†](#Dt_CR173) me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children so.’

**11**  And [†](#Dt_CR174) you came near and stood at the foot of the mountain, while [†](#Dt_CR175) the mountain burned with fire to the heart of heaven, wrapped in darkness, cloud, and gloom.

**12**  Then [†](#Dt_CR176) the L**ORD** spoke to you out of the midst of the fire. You heard the sound of words, [†](#Dt_CR177) but saw no form; [†](#Dt_CR178) there was only a voice.

**13** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR179) And he declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, that is, [†](#Dt_CR180) the Ten Commandments, [*](#Dt_NB7) [†](#Dt_CR181) and he wrote them on two tablets of stone.

**14**  And [†](#Dt_CR182) the L**ORD** commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and rules, that you might do them in the land that you are going over to possess.

**15** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR183) “Therefore watch yourselves very carefully. Since [†](#Dt_CR184) you saw no form on the day that the L**ORD** spoke to you at Horeb out of the midst of the fire,

**16**  beware [†](#Dt_CR185) lest you act corruptly [†](#Dt_CR186) by making a carved image for yourselves, in the form of any figure, [†](#Dt_CR187) the likeness of male or female,

**17**  the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the air,

**18**  the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth.

**19**  And beware lest you raise your eyes to heaven, and when you see [†](#Dt_CR188) the sun and the moon and the stars, [†](#Dt_CR189) all the host of heaven, you be drawn away and bow down to them and serve them, things that the L**ORD** your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven.

**20** [✞] But the L**ORD** has taken you and [†](#Dt_CR190) brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, [†](#Dt_CR191) to be a people of his own inheritance, as you are this day.

**21** [✞] Furthermore, [†](#Dt_CR192) the L**ORD** was angry with me because of you, and he swore that I should not cross the Jordan, and that I should not enter the good land that the L**ORD** your God is giving you for an inheritance.

**22**  For I must die in this land; [†](#Dt_CR193) I must not go over the Jordan. But you shall go over and take possession of [†](#Dt_CR194) that good land.

**23**  [†](#Dt_CR195) Take care, lest you forget the covenant of the L**ORD** your God, which he made with you, and [†](#Dt_CR196) make a carved image, the form of anything that the L**ORD** your God has forbidden you.

**24** [✞] For [†](#Dt_CR197) the L**ORD** your God is a consuming fire, [†](#Dt_CR198) a jealous God.

**25** [✞] “When you father children and children’s children, and have grown old in the land, [†](#Dt_CR199) if you act corruptly by making a carved image in the form of anything, and [†](#Dt_CR200) by doing what is evil in the sight of the L**ORD** your God, so as to provoke him to anger,

**26**  I [†](#Dt_CR201) call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that you will soon utterly perish from the land that you are going over the Jordan to possess. You will not live long in it, but will be utterly destroyed.

**27** [✞] And the L**ORD** [†](#Dt_CR202) will scatter you among the peoples, [†](#Dt_CR203) and you will be left few in number among the nations where the L**ORD** will drive you.

**28**  And [†](#Dt_CR204) there you will serve gods of wood and stone, the work of human hands, [†](#Dt_CR205) that neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.

**29**  [†](#Dt_CR206) But from there you will seek the L**ORD** your God and you will find him, if you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul.

**30** [✞] When you are in tribulation, and all these things come upon you [†](#Dt_CR207) in the latter days, you will return to the L**ORD** your God and obey his voice.

**31** [✞] For the L**ORD** your God is [†](#Dt_CR208) a merciful God. [†](#Dt_CR209) He will not leave you or destroy you or forget the covenant with your fathers that he swore to them.

**32** [✞] “For [†](#Dt_CR210) ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and ask from one end of heaven to the other, whether such a great thing as this has ever happened or was ever heard of.

**33**  [†](#Dt_CR211) Did any people ever hear the voice of a god speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and still live?

**34** [✞] Or has any god ever attempted to go and take a nation for himself from the midst of another nation, by trials, [†](#Dt_CR212) by signs, by wonders, and [†](#Dt_CR213) by war, [†](#Dt_CR214) by a mighty hand and [†](#Dt_CR215) an outstretched arm, and by great deeds of terror, all of which the L**ORD** your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?

**35**  To you it was shown, [†](#Dt_CR216) that you might know that the L**ORD** is God; [†](#Dt_CR217) there is no other besides him.

**36**  [†](#Dt_CR218) Out of heaven he let you hear his voice, that he might discipline you. And on earth he let you see his great fire, and [†](#Dt_CR219) you heard his words out of the midst of the fire.

**37** [✞] And because [†](#Dt_CR220) he loved your fathers and chose their offspring after them [*](#Dt_NB8) and brought you out of Egypt [†](#Dt_CR221) with his own presence, by his great power,

**38**  [†](#Dt_CR222) driving out before you nations greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is this day,

**39**  know therefore today, and lay it to your heart, that [†](#Dt_CR223) the L**ORD** is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath; [†](#Dt_CR224) there is no other.

**40**  [†](#Dt_CR225) Therefore you shall keep his statutes and his commandments, which I command you today, [†](#Dt_CR226) that it may go well with you and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days in the land that the L**ORD** your God is giving you for all time.”

**41** [✞] Then Moses [†](#Dt_CR227) set apart three cities in the east beyond the Jordan,

**42**  that [†](#Dt_CR228) the manslayer might flee there, anyone who kills his neighbor unintentionally, without being at enmity with him in time past; he may flee to one of these cities and save his life:

**43**  [†](#Dt_CR229) Bezer in the wilderness on the [†](#Dt_CR230) tableland for the Reubenites, Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites.

**44** [✞] This is the law that Moses set before the people of Israel.

**45** [✞] These are the testimonies, the statutes, and the rules, which Moses spoke to the people of Israel when they came out of Egypt,

**46**  beyond the Jordan [†](#Dt_CR231) in the valley opposite Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon, [†](#Dt_CR232) whom Moses and the people of Israel defeated when they came out of Egypt.

**47**  And they took possession of his land and the land [†](#Dt_CR233) of Og, the king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who lived to the east beyond the Jordan;

**48**  [†](#Dt_CR234) from Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, as far as Mount [†](#Dt_CR235) Sirion [*](#Dt_NB9) (that is, [†](#Dt_CR236) Hermon),

**49** [✞] together with all the Arabah on the east side of the Jordan as far as [†](#Dt_CR237) the Sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.5 [✞] And Moses summoned all Israel and said to them, “Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the rules that I speak in your hearing today, and you shall learn them and be careful to do them.

**2**  [†](#Dt_CR238) The L**ORD** our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.

**3** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR239) Not with our fathers did the L**ORD** make this covenant, but with us, who are all of us here alive today.

**4** [✞] The L**ORD** spoke with you [†](#Dt_CR240) face to face at the mountain, out of the midst of the fire,

**5**  [†](#Dt_CR241) while I stood between the L**ORD** and you at that time, to declare to you the word of the L**ORD**. For [†](#Dt_CR242) you were afraid because of the fire, and you did not go up into the mountain. He said:

**6** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR243) “‘I am the L**ORD** your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.

**7** [✞] “‘You shall have no other gods before [*](#Dt_NB10) me.

**8** [✞] “‘You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.

**9**  You shall not bow down to them or serve them; for I the L**ORD** your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,

**10** [✞] but showing steadfast love to [†](#Dt_CR244) thousands [*](#Dt_NB11) of those who love me and keep my commandments.

**11**  “‘You shall not take the name of the L**ORD** your God in vain, for the L**ORD** will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.

**12** [✞] “‘Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as the L**ORD** your God commanded you.

**13**  Six days you shall labor and do all your work,

**14**  but [†](#Dt_CR245) the seventh day is a Sabbath to the L**ORD** your God. On it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter or your male servant or your female servant, or your ox or your donkey or any of your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates, [†](#Dt_CR246) that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you.

**15**  [†](#Dt_CR247) You shall remember that you were a slave [*](#Dt_NB12) in the land of Egypt, and the L**ORD** your God brought you out from there [†](#Dt_CR248) with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the L**ORD** your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.

**16** [✞] “‘Honor your father and your mother, as the L**ORD** your God commanded you, [†](#Dt_CR249) that your days may be long, and that it may go well with you in the land that the L**ORD** your God is giving you.

**17**  [†](#Dt_CR250) “‘You shall not murder. [*](#Dt_NB13)

**18**  [†](#Dt_CR251) “‘And you shall not commit adultery.

**19**  “‘And you shall not steal.

**20**  “‘And you shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.

**21**  “‘And you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife. And you shall not desire your neighbor’s house, his field, or his male servant, or his female servant, his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor’s.’

**22** [✞] “These words the L**ORD** spoke to all your assembly [†](#Dt_CR252) at the mountain out of the midst of the fire, the cloud, and the thick darkness, with a loud voice; and he added no more. And [†](#Dt_CR253) he wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me.

**23**  And [†](#Dt_CR254) as soon as you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, you came near to me, all the heads of your tribes, and your elders.

**24**  And you said, ‘Behold, the L**ORD** our God has shown us his glory and [†](#Dt_CR255) greatness, and [†](#Dt_CR256) we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire. This day we have seen God speak with man, and man [†](#Dt_CR257) still live.

**25**  Now therefore why should we die? For this great fire will consume us. [†](#Dt_CR258) If we hear the voice of the L**ORD** our God any more, we shall die.

**26**  [†](#Dt_CR259) For who is there of all flesh, that has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of fire as we have, and has still lived?

**27**  Go near and hear all that the L**ORD** our God will say, and [†](#Dt_CR260) speak to us all that the L**ORD** our God will speak to you, and we will hear and do it.’

**28**  “And the L**ORD** heard your words, when you spoke to me. And the L**ORD** said to me, ‘I have heard the words of this people, which they have spoken to you. [†](#Dt_CR261) They are right in all that they have spoken.

**29**  [†](#Dt_CR262) Oh that they had such a heart as this always, to fear me and to keep all my commandments, [†](#Dt_CR263) that it might go well with them and with their descendants [*](#Dt_NB14) forever!

**30**  Go and say to them, “Return to your tents.”

**31**  But you, stand here by me, and [†](#Dt_CR264) I will tell you the whole commandment and the statutes and the rules that you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land that I am giving them to possess.’

**32**  You shall be careful therefore to do as the L**ORD** your God has commanded you. [†](#Dt_CR265) You shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.

**33**  [†](#Dt_CR266) You shall walk in all the way that the L**ORD** your God has commanded you, that you may live, and [†](#Dt_CR267) that it may go well with you, and that you may live long in the land that you shall possess.6 “Now this is [†](#Dt_CR268) the commandment—the statutes and the rules [*](#Dt_NB15)—that the L**ORD** your God commanded me to teach you, that you may do them in the land to which you are going over, to possess it,

**2** [✞] that [†](#Dt_CR269) you may fear the L**ORD** your God, you and your son and your son’s son, by keeping all his statutes and his commandments, which I command you, all the days of your life, and [†](#Dt_CR270) that your days may be long.

**3**  Hear therefore, O Israel, and be careful to do them, that it may go well with you, and that you may multiply greatly, [†](#Dt_CR271) as the L**ORD**, the God of your fathers, has promised you, in a land flowing with milk and honey.

**4** [✞] “Hear, O Israel: [†](#Dt_CR272) The L**ORD** our God, the L**ORD** is one. [*](#Dt_NB16)

**5** [✞] You [†](#Dt_CR273) shall love the L**ORD** your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.

**6**  And [†](#Dt_CR274) these words that I command you today shall be on your heart.

**7**  [†](#Dt_CR275) You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise.

**8** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR276) You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.

**9**  [†](#Dt_CR277) You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.

**10** [✞] “And when the L**ORD** your God brings you into the land that he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you—with great and good cities [†](#Dt_CR278) that you did not build,

**11**  and houses full of all good things that you did not fill, and cisterns that you did not dig, and vineyards and olive trees that you did not plant—and when you eat and are full,

**12**  [†](#Dt_CR279) then take care lest you forget the L**ORD**, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.

**13** [✞] It is [†](#Dt_CR280) the L**ORD** your God you shall fear. Him you shall serve and [†](#Dt_CR281) by his name you shall swear.

**14**  You shall not [†](#Dt_CR282) go after other gods, [†](#Dt_CR283) the gods of the peoples who are around you—

**15** [✞] for [†](#Dt_CR284) the L**ORD** your God in your midst [†](#Dt_CR285) is a jealous God—[†](#Dt_CR286) lest the anger of the L**ORD** your God be kindled against you, and he destroy you from off the face of the earth.

**16** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR287) “You shall not put the L**ORD** your God to the test, [†](#Dt_CR288) as you tested him at Massah.

**17**  You shall [†](#Dt_CR289) diligently keep the commandments of the L**ORD** your God, and his testimonies and his statutes, which he has commanded you.

**18**  [†](#Dt_CR290) And you shall do what is right and good in the sight of the L**ORD**, that it may go well with you, and that you may go in and take possession of the good land that the L**ORD** swore to give to your fathers

**19**  [†](#Dt_CR291) by thrusting out all your enemies from before you, as the L**ORD** has promised.

**20** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR292) “When your son asks you in time to come, ‘What is the meaning of the testimonies and the statutes and the rules that the L**ORD** our God has commanded you?’

**21**  then you shall say to your son, [†](#Dt_CR293) ‘We were Pharaoh’s slaves in Egypt. And the L**ORD** brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand.

**22**  And [†](#Dt_CR294) the L**ORD** showed signs and wonders, great and grievous, against Egypt and against Pharaoh and all his household, before our eyes.

**23**  And he brought us out from there, that he might bring us in and give us the land that he swore to give to our fathers.

**24** [✞] And the L**ORD** commanded us to do all these statutes, [†](#Dt_CR295) to fear the L**ORD** our God, [†](#Dt_CR296) for our good always, that [†](#Dt_CR297) he might preserve us alive, as we are this day.

**25**  And [†](#Dt_CR298) it will be righteousness for us, if we are careful to do all this commandment before the L**ORD** our God, as he has commanded us.’7 [✞] “When the [†](#Dt_CR299) L**ORD** your God brings you into the land that you are entering to take possession of it, and clears away many nations before you, [†](#Dt_CR300) the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations [†](#Dt_CR301) more numerous and mightier than you,

**2** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR302) and when the L**ORD** your God gives them over to you, and you defeat them, then you must [†](#Dt_CR303) devote them to complete destruction. [*](#Dt_NB17) [†](#Dt_CR304) You shall make no covenant with them and show no mercy to them.

**3** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR305) You shall not intermarry with them, giving your daughters to their sons or taking their daughters for your sons,

**4**  for they would turn away your sons from following me, to serve other gods. [†](#Dt_CR306) Then the anger of the L**ORD** would be kindled against you, and he would destroy you [†](#Dt_CR307) quickly.

**5** [✞] But thus shall you deal with them: [†](#Dt_CR308) you shall break down their altars and dash in pieces their [†](#Dt_CR308) pillars and chop down their [†](#Dt_CR308) Asherim and [†](#Dt_CR309) burn their carved images with fire.

**6**  “For [†](#Dt_CR310) you are a people holy to the L**ORD** your God. The L**ORD** your God has chosen you to be [†](#Dt_CR310) a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.

**7**  It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the L**ORD** set his love on you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples,

**8** [✞] but [†](#Dt_CR311) it is because the L**ORD** loves you and is keeping [†](#Dt_CR312) the oath that he swore to your fathers, that the L**ORD** has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.

**9** [✞] Know therefore that the L**ORD** your God is God, [†](#Dt_CR313) the faithful God [†](#Dt_CR314) who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments, to a thousand generations,

**10**  and [†](#Dt_CR315) repays to their face those who hate him, by destroying them. [†](#Dt_CR316) He will not be slack with one who hates him. He will repay him to his face.

**11**  [†](#Dt_CR317) You shall therefore be careful to do the commandment and the statutes and the rules that I command you today.

**12**  [†](#Dt_CR318) “And because you listen to these rules and keep and do them, the L**ORD** your God will keep with you [†](#Dt_CR319) the covenant and the steadfast love that he swore to your fathers.

**13** [✞] He will [†](#Dt_CR320) love you, bless you, and multiply you. [†](#Dt_CR321) He will also bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your wine and your oil, the increase of your herds and the young of your flock, in the land that he swore to your fathers to give you.

**14**  You shall be blessed above all peoples. [†](#Dt_CR322) There shall not be male or female barren among you or among your livestock.

**15** [✞] And the L**ORD** will take away from you all sickness, and none of the evil [†](#Dt_CR323) diseases of Egypt, which you knew, will he inflict on you, but he will lay them on all who hate you.

**16**  And [†](#Dt_CR324) you shall consume all the peoples that the L**ORD** your God will give over to you. [†](#Dt_CR325) Your eye shall not pity them, neither shall you serve their gods, for that would be [†](#Dt_CR326) a snare to you.

**17**  “If you say in your heart, ‘These nations are greater than I. How can I dispossess them?’

**18**  [†](#Dt_CR327) you shall not be afraid of them but you shall [†](#Dt_CR328) remember what the L**ORD** your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt,

**19**  the great trials that your eyes saw, [†](#Dt_CR329) the signs, the wonders, the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, by which the L**ORD** your God brought you out. So will the L**ORD** your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.

**20** [✞] Moreover, [†](#Dt_CR330) the L**ORD** your God will send hornets among them, until those who are left and hide themselves from you are destroyed.

**21** [✞] You shall not be in dread of them, for the L**ORD** your God is [†](#Dt_CR331) in your midst, [†](#Dt_CR332) a great and awesome God.

**22**  [†](#Dt_CR333) The L**ORD** your God will clear away these nations before you little by little. You may not make an end of them at once, [*](#Dt_NB18) lest the wild beasts grow too numerous for you.

**23**  [†](#Dt_CR334) But the L**ORD** your God will give them over to you and throw them into great confusion, until they are destroyed.

**24**  And [†](#Dt_CR335) he will give their kings into your hand, and you shall [†](#Dt_CR336) make their name perish from under heaven. [†](#Dt_CR337) No one shall be able to stand against you until you have destroyed them.

**25** [✞] The carved images of their gods [†](#Dt_CR338) you shall burn with fire. You [†](#Dt_CR339) shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them or take it for yourselves, lest you be [†](#Dt_CR340) ensnared by it, for it is an abomination to the L**ORD** your God.

**26**  And you shall not bring an abominable thing into your house and become devoted to destruction [*](#Dt_NB19) like it. You shall utterly detest and abhor it, [†](#Dt_CR341) for it is devoted to destruction.8 “The whole commandment that I command you today [†](#Dt_CR342) you shall be careful to do, that you may live and multiply, and go in and possess the land that the L**ORD** swore to give to your fathers.

**2**  And you shall remember the whole way that the L**ORD** your God has led you [†](#Dt_CR343) these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble you, [†](#Dt_CR344) testing you [†](#Dt_CR345) to know what was in your heart, [†](#Dt_CR346) whether you would keep his commandments or not.

**3** [✞] And he humbled you and [†](#Dt_CR347) let you hunger and [†](#Dt_CR348) fed you with manna, which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that he might make you know that [†](#Dt_CR349) man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by every word [*](#Dt_NB20) that comes from the mouth of the L**ORD**.

**4** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR350) Your clothing did not wear out on you and your foot did not swell these forty years.

**5** [✞] Know then in your heart that, [†](#Dt_CR351) as a man disciplines his son, the L**ORD** your God disciplines you.

**6**  So you shall keep the commandments of the L**ORD** your God by walking in his ways and by fearing him.

**7** [✞] For the L**ORD** your God is bringing you into a good land, [†](#Dt_CR352) a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, flowing out in the valleys and hills,

**8**  a land of wheat and barley, [†](#Dt_CR353) of vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land of olive trees and honey,

**9** [✞] a land in which you will eat bread without scarcity, in which you will lack nothing, a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you can dig copper.

**10**  And you shall eat and be full, and you shall bless the L**ORD** your God for the good land he has given you.

**11**  “Take care lest you forget the L**ORD** your God by not keeping his commandments and his rules and his statutes, which I command you today,

**12**  [†](#Dt_CR354) lest, when you have eaten and are full and have built good houses and live in them,

**13**  and when your herds and flocks multiply and your silver and gold is multiplied and all that you have is multiplied,

**14**  [†](#Dt_CR355) then your heart be lifted up, and you [†](#Dt_CR356) forget the L**ORD** your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery,

**15**  who [†](#Dt_CR357) led you through the great and terrifying wilderness, [†](#Dt_CR358) with its fiery serpents and scorpions [†](#Dt_CR359) and thirsty ground where there was no water, [†](#Dt_CR360) who brought you water out of the flinty rock,

**16**  who fed you in the wilderness with [†](#Dt_CR361) manna that your fathers did not know, that he might humble you and test you, [†](#Dt_CR362) to do you good in the end.

**17**  Beware [†](#Dt_CR363) lest you say in your heart, ‘My power and the might of my hand have gotten me this wealth.’

**18**  You shall remember the L**ORD** your God, for [†](#Dt_CR364) it is he who gives you power to get wealth, [†](#Dt_CR365) that he may confirm his covenant that he swore to your fathers, as it is this day.

**19** [✞] And if you forget the L**ORD** your God and go after other gods and serve them and worship them, [†](#Dt_CR366) I solemnly warn you today that you shall surely perish.

**20**  Like the nations that the L**ORD** makes to perish before you, [†](#Dt_CR367) so shall you perish, because you would not obey the voice of the L**ORD** your God.9 [✞] “Hear, O Israel: you are [†](#Dt_CR368) to cross over the Jordan today, to go in to dispossess nations [†](#Dt_CR369) greater and mightier than you, cities great and fortified up to heaven,

**2** [✞] a people great and tall, [†](#Dt_CR370) the sons of the Anakim, [†](#Dt_CR371) whom you know, and of whom you have heard it said, ‘Who can stand before the sons of Anak?’

**3**  Know therefore today that he who [†](#Dt_CR372) goes over before you [†](#Dt_CR373) as a consuming fire is the L**ORD** your God. He will destroy them and subdue them before you. [†](#Dt_CR374) So you shall drive them out and make them perish quickly, as the L**ORD** has promised you.

**4** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR375) “Do not say in your heart, after the L**ORD** your God has thrust them out before you, ‘It is because of my righteousness that the L**ORD** has brought me in to possess this land,’ whereas it is [†](#Dt_CR376) because of the wickedness of these nations that the L**ORD** is driving them out before you.

**5**  [†](#Dt_CR377) Not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart are you going in to possess their land, but because of the wickedness of these nations the L**ORD** your God is driving them out from before you, and that he may confirm [†](#Dt_CR378) the word that the L**ORD** swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

**6**  “Know, therefore, that the L**ORD** your God is not giving you this good land to possess because of your righteousness, for you are [†](#Dt_CR379) a stubborn people.

**7**  Remember and do not forget how you provoked the L**ORD** your God to wrath in the wilderness. [†](#Dt_CR380) From the day you came out of the land of Egypt until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against the L**ORD**.

**8**  Even [†](#Dt_CR381) at Horeb you provoked the L**ORD** to wrath, and the L**ORD** was so angry with you that he was ready to destroy you.

**9** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR382) When I went up the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that the L**ORD** made with you, I remained on the mountain [†](#Dt_CR383) forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water.

**10**  And [†](#Dt_CR384) the L**ORD** gave me the two tablets of stone written with the finger of God, and on them were all the words that the L**ORD** had spoken with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire [†](#Dt_CR385) on the day of the assembly.

**11**  And at the end of forty days and forty nights the L**ORD** gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant.

**12**  Then the L**ORD** said to me, [†](#Dt_CR386) ‘Arise, go down quickly from here, for your people whom you have brought from Egypt have acted corruptly. They have [†](#Dt_CR387) turned aside quickly out of the way that I commanded them; they have made themselves a metal image.’

**13**  [†](#Dt_CR388) “Furthermore, the L**ORD** said to me, ‘I have seen this people, and behold, it is [†](#Dt_CR389) a stubborn people.

**14**  [†](#Dt_CR390) Let me alone, that I may destroy them and [†](#Dt_CR391) blot out their name from under heaven. And [†](#Dt_CR392) I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.’

**15**  [†](#Dt_CR393) So I turned and came down from the mountain, and [†](#Dt_CR394) the mountain was burning with fire. And the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands.

**16**  And [†](#Dt_CR395) I looked, and behold, you had sinned against the L**ORD** your God. You had made yourselves a golden [*](#Dt_NB21) calf. [†](#Dt_CR396) You had turned aside quickly from the way that the L**ORD** had commanded you.

**17**  So I took hold of the two tablets and threw them out of my two hands and broke them before your eyes.

**18**  Then I [†](#Dt_CR397) lay prostrate before the L**ORD** [†](#Dt_CR398) as before, forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all the sin that you had committed, [†](#Dt_CR399) in doing what was evil in the sight of the L**ORD** to provoke him to anger.

**19**  For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure that the L**ORD** bore against you, so that he was ready to destroy you. [†](#Dt_CR400) But the L**ORD** listened to me that time also.

**20**  And the L**ORD** was so angry with Aaron that he was ready to destroy him. And I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.

**21** [✞] Then [†](#Dt_CR401) I took the sinful thing, the calf that you had made, and burned it with fire and crushed it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust. And I threw the dust of it into the brook that ran down from the mountain.

**22** [✞] “At [†](#Dt_CR402) Taberah also, and at [†](#Dt_CR403) Massah and at [†](#Dt_CR404) Kibroth-hattaavah you provoked the L**ORD** to wrath.

**23** [✞] And [†](#Dt_CR405) when the L**ORD** sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, ‘Go up and take possession of the land that I have given you,’ then you rebelled against the commandment of the L**ORD** your God and [†](#Dt_CR406) did not believe him or obey his voice.

**24**  [†](#Dt_CR407) You have been rebellious against the L**ORD** from the day that I knew you.

**25**  [†](#Dt_CR408) “So I lay prostrate before the L**ORD** for these forty days and forty nights, because the L**ORD** had said he would destroy you.

**26**  [†](#Dt_CR409) And I prayed to the L**ORD**, ‘O Lord G**OD**, do not destroy your people and your heritage, whom you have redeemed through your greatness, whom you have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.

**27**  Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Do not regard the stubbornness of this people, or their wickedness or their sin,

**28**  lest the land from which you brought us say, [†](#Dt_CR410) “Because the L**ORD** was not able to bring them into the land that he promised them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to put them to death in the wilderness.”

**29**  [†](#Dt_CR411) For they are your people and your heritage, whom you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.’10 [✞] “At that time the L**ORD** said to me, [†](#Dt_CR412) ‘Cut for yourself two tablets of stone like the first, and come up to me on the mountain and [†](#Dt_CR413) make an ark of wood.

**2**  And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets that you broke, and [†](#Dt_CR414) you shall put them in the ark.’

**3**  So I made an ark [†](#Dt_CR415) of acacia wood, and [†](#Dt_CR416) cut two tablets of stone like the first, and went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hand.

**4** [✞] And [†](#Dt_CR417) he wrote on the tablets, in the same writing as before, the Ten Commandments [*](#Dt_NB22) [†](#Dt_CR418) that the L**ORD** had spoken to you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire [†](#Dt_CR419) on the day of the assembly. And the L**ORD** gave them to me.

**5**  Then I turned and [†](#Dt_CR420) came down from the mountain and [†](#Dt_CR421) put the tablets in the ark that I had made. [†](#Dt_CR422) And there they are, as the L**ORD** commanded me.”

**6** [✞] (The people of Israel [†](#Dt_CR423) journeyed from Beeroth Bene-jaakan [*](#Dt_NB23) to Moserah. [†](#Dt_CR424) There Aaron died, and there he was buried. And his son Eleazar ministered as priest in his place.

**7**  [†](#Dt_CR425) From there they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land with brooks of water.

**8** [✞] At that time [†](#Dt_CR426) the L**ORD** set apart the tribe of Levi [†](#Dt_CR427) to carry the ark of the covenant of the L**ORD** [†](#Dt_CR428) to stand before the L**ORD** to minister to him and [†](#Dt_CR429) to bless in his name, to this day.

**9**  [†](#Dt_CR430) Therefore Levi has no portion or inheritance with his brothers. The L**ORD** is his inheritance, as the L**ORD** your God said to him.)

**10**  [†](#Dt_CR431) “I myself stayed on the mountain, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights, [†](#Dt_CR432) and the L**ORD** listened to me that time also. The L**ORD** was unwilling to destroy you.

**11** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR433) And the L**ORD** said to me, ‘Arise, go on your journey at the head of the people, so that they may go in and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers to give them.’

**12** [✞] “And now, Israel, [†](#Dt_CR434) what does the L**ORD** your God require of you, but [†](#Dt_CR435) to fear the L**ORD** your God, [†](#Dt_CR436) to walk in all his ways, [†](#Dt_CR437) to love him, to serve the L**ORD** your God with all your heart and with all your soul,

**13**  and [†](#Dt_CR438) to keep the commandments and statutes of the L**ORD**, which I am commanding you today [†](#Dt_CR439) for your good?

**14**  Behold, [†](#Dt_CR440) to the L**ORD** your God belong heaven and the heaven of heavens, [†](#Dt_CR441) the earth with all that is in it.

**15** [✞] Yet [†](#Dt_CR442) the L**ORD** set his heart in love on your fathers and chose their offspring after them, you above all peoples, as you are this day.

**16** [✞] Circumcise therefore [†](#Dt_CR443) the foreskin of your heart, and be no longer [†](#Dt_CR444) stubborn.

**17**  For the L**ORD** your God is [†](#Dt_CR445) God of gods and [†](#Dt_CR446) Lord of lords, [†](#Dt_CR447) the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who is [†](#Dt_CR448) not partial and takes no bribe.

**18** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR449) He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the sojourner, giving him food and clothing.

**19**  [†](#Dt_CR450) Love the sojourner, therefore, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt.

**20**  [†](#Dt_CR451) You shall fear the L**ORD** your God. You shall serve him and [†](#Dt_CR452) hold fast to him, and [†](#Dt_CR453) by his name you shall swear.

**21**  [†](#Dt_CR454) He is your praise. He is your God, [†](#Dt_CR455) who has done for you these great and terrifying things that your eyes have seen.

**22** [✞] Your fathers went down to Egypt [†](#Dt_CR456) seventy persons, and now the L**ORD** your God has made you [†](#Dt_CR457) as numerous as the stars of heaven.11 [†](#Dt_CR458) “You shall therefore love the L**ORD** your God and [†](#Dt_CR459) keep his charge, his statutes, his rules, and his commandments always.

**2** [✞] And consider today (since I am not speaking to [†](#Dt_CR460) your children who have not known or seen it), consider the discipline [*](#Dt_NB24) of the L**ORD** your God, [†](#Dt_CR461) his greatness, [†](#Dt_CR462) his mighty hand and his outstretched arm,

**3**  [†](#Dt_CR463) his signs and his deeds that he did in Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt and to all his land,

**4**  and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses and to their chariots, [†](#Dt_CR464) how he made the water of the Red Sea flow over them as they pursued after you, and how the L**ORD** has destroyed them to this day,

**5**  and [†](#Dt_CR465) what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came to this place,

**6** [✞] and [†](#Dt_CR466) what he did to Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, son of Reuben, how the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households, their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel.

**7**  For your eyes have seen [†](#Dt_CR467) all the great work of the L**ORD** that he did.

**8**  “You shall therefore keep the whole commandment that I command you today, that you may [†](#Dt_CR468) be strong, and go in and take possession of the land that you are going over to possess,

**9** [✞] and [†](#Dt_CR469) that you may live long in the land [†](#Dt_CR470) that the L**ORD** swore to your fathers to give to them and to their offspring, [†](#Dt_CR471) a land flowing with milk and honey.

**10** [✞] For the land that you are entering to take possession of it is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come, where you sowed your seed and irrigated it, [*](#Dt_NB25) like a garden of vegetables.

**11**  [†](#Dt_CR472) But the land that you are going over to possess is a land of hills and valleys, which drinks water by the rain from heaven,

**12**  a land that the L**ORD** your God cares for. [†](#Dt_CR473) The eyes of the L**ORD** your God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.

**13** [✞] “And if you will indeed obey my commandments that I command you today, [†](#Dt_CR474) to love the L**ORD** your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,

**14** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR475) he [*](#Dt_NB26) will give the rain for your land in its season, [†](#Dt_CR476) the early rain and the later rain, that you may gather in your grain and your wine and your oil.

**15**  [†](#Dt_CR477) And he will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and [†](#Dt_CR478) you shall eat and be full.

**16**  Take care [†](#Dt_CR479) lest your heart be deceived, and you turn aside and [†](#Dt_CR480) serve other gods and worship them;

**17**  then [†](#Dt_CR481) the anger of the L**ORD** will be kindled against you, and he [†](#Dt_CR482) will shut up the heavens, so that there will be no rain, and the land will yield no fruit, and [†](#Dt_CR483) you will perish quickly off the good land that the L**ORD** is giving you.

**18**  [†](#Dt_CR484) “You shall therefore lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your soul, and [†](#Dt_CR485) you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.

**19** [✞] You shall teach them to your children, talking of them when you are sitting in your house, and when you are walking by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise.

**20**  [†](#Dt_CR486) You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates,

**21**  [†](#Dt_CR487) that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land that the L**ORD** swore to your fathers to give them, [†](#Dt_CR488) as long as the heavens are above the earth.

**22**  For if [†](#Dt_CR489) you will be careful to do all this commandment that I command you to do, loving the L**ORD** your God, walking in all his ways, and [†](#Dt_CR490) holding fast to him,

**23**  then the L**ORD** [†](#Dt_CR491) will drive out all these nations before you, and you will [†](#Dt_CR492) dispossess nations greater and mightier than you.

**24** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR493) Every place on which the sole of your foot treads shall be yours. Your territory shall be [†](#Dt_CR494) from the wilderness to [*](#Dt_NB27) the Lebanon and from the River, the river Euphrates, to the western sea.

**25**  [†](#Dt_CR495) No one shall be able to stand against you. The L**ORD** your God will lay [†](#Dt_CR496) the fear of you and the dread of you on all the land that you shall tread, [†](#Dt_CR497) as he promised you.

**26** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR498) “See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse:

**27**  [†](#Dt_CR499) the blessing, if you obey the commandments of the L**ORD** your God, which I command you today,

**28**  and [†](#Dt_CR500) the curse, if you do not obey the commandments of the L**ORD** your God, but turn aside from the way that I am commanding you today, [†](#Dt_CR501) to go after other gods that you have not known.

**29** [✞] And when the L**ORD** your God brings you into the land that you are entering to take possession of it, you shall set [†](#Dt_CR502) the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.

**30**  Are they not beyond the Jordan, west of the road, toward the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites who live in the [†](#Dt_CR503) Arabah, opposite Gilgal, beside [†](#Dt_CR504) the oak [*](#Dt_NB28) of Moreh?

**31**  For you are [†](#Dt_CR505) to cross over the Jordan to go in to take possession of the land that the L**ORD** your God is giving you. And when you possess it and live in it,

**32**  you shall be careful [†](#Dt_CR506) to do all the statutes and the rules that I am setting before you today.12 [✞] [†](#Dt_CR507) “These are the statutes and rules that you shall be careful to do in the land that the L**ORD**, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess, [†](#Dt_CR508) all the days that you live on the earth.

**2**  [†](#Dt_CR509) You shall surely destroy all the places where the nations whom you shall dispossess served their gods, [†](#Dt_CR510) on the high mountains and on the hills and under every green tree.

**3**  You shall tear down their altars and dash in pieces [†](#Dt_CR511) their pillars and burn their [†](#Dt_CR512) Asherim with fire. You shall chop down the carved images of their gods and [†](#Dt_CR513) destroy their name out of that place.

**4**  [†](#Dt_CR514) You shall not worship the L**ORD** your God in that way.

**5** [✞] But you shall seek [†](#Dt_CR515) the place that the L**ORD** your God will choose out of all your tribes to put his name and make his habitation [*](#Dt_NB29) there. There you shall go,

**6**  and there you shall bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, [†](#Dt_CR516) your tithes and the contribution that you present, your vow offerings, your freewill offerings, and the [†](#Dt_CR517) firstborn of your herd and of your flock.

**7** [✞] And [†](#Dt_CR518) there you shall eat before the L**ORD** your God, and [†](#Dt_CR519) you shall rejoice, you and your households, in all that you undertake, in which the L**ORD** your God has blessed you.

**8**  “You shall not do according to all that we are doing here today, [†](#Dt_CR520) everyone doing whatever is right in his own eyes,

**9**  for you have not as yet come to [†](#Dt_CR521) the rest and to the inheritance that the L**ORD** your God is giving you.

**10**  But when [†](#Dt_CR522) you go over the Jordan and live in the land that the L**ORD** your God is giving you to inherit, [†](#Dt_CR523) and when he gives you rest from all your enemies around, so that you live in safety,

**11**  then to [†](#Dt_CR524) the place that the L**ORD** your God will choose, to make his name dwell there, there you shall bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, [†](#Dt_CR525) your tithes and the contribution that you present, and all your finest vow offerings that you vow to the L**ORD**.

**12** [✞] And [†](#Dt_CR526) you shall rejoice before the L**ORD** your God, you and your sons and your daughters, your male servants and your female servants, and the Levite that is within your towns, since [†](#Dt_CR527) he has no portion or inheritance with you.

**13**  [†](#Dt_CR528) Take care that you do not offer your burnt offerings at any place that you see,

**14**  but at [†](#Dt_CR529) the place that the L**ORD** will choose in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I am commanding you.

**15** [✞] “However, you may slaughter and eat meat within any of your towns, as much as you desire, [†](#Dt_CR530) according to the blessing of the L**ORD** your God that he has given you. [†](#Dt_CR531) The unclean and the clean may eat of it, as of the gazelle and as of the deer.

**16**  [†](#Dt_CR532) Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it out on the earth like water.

**17**  You may not eat within your towns [†](#Dt_CR533) the tithe of your grain or of your wine or of your oil, or the firstborn of your herd or of your flock, or any of your vow offerings that you vow, or your freewill offerings or the contribution that you present,

**18**  but [†](#Dt_CR534) you shall eat them before the L**ORD** your God in [†](#Dt_CR535) the place that the L**ORD** your God will choose, you and your son and your daughter, your male servant and your female servant, and the Levite who is within your towns. And [†](#Dt_CR536) you shall rejoice before the L**ORD** your God in all that you undertake.

**19**  [†](#Dt_CR537) Take care that you do not neglect the Levite as long as you live in your land.

**20**  “When the L**ORD** your God [†](#Dt_CR538) enlarges your territory, [†](#Dt_CR539) as he has promised you, and you say, ‘I will eat meat,’ because you crave meat, you may eat meat whenever you desire.

**21** [✞] If [†](#Dt_CR540) the place that the L**ORD** your God will choose to put his name there is too far from you, [†](#Dt_CR541) then you may kill any of your herd or your flock, which the L**ORD** has given you, as I have commanded you, and you may eat within your towns whenever you desire.

**22**  Just [†](#Dt_CR542) as the gazelle or the deer is eaten, so you may eat of it. [†](#Dt_CR542) The unclean and the clean alike may eat of it.

**23** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR543) Only be sure that you do not eat the blood, [†](#Dt_CR544) for the blood is the life, and you shall not eat the life with the flesh.

**24**  You shall not eat it; you shall pour it out on the earth like water.

**25**  You shall not eat it, [†](#Dt_CR545) that all may go well with you and with your children after you, [†](#Dt_CR546) when you do what is right in the sight of the L**ORD**.

**26**  But the [†](#Dt_CR547) holy things that are due from you, and [†](#Dt_CR548) your vow offerings, you shall take, and you shall go to [†](#Dt_CR549) the place that the L**ORD** will choose,

**27**  and [†](#Dt_CR550) offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, on the altar of the L**ORD** your God. The blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of the L**ORD** your God, but the flesh you may eat.

**28**  Be careful to obey all these words that I command you, [†](#Dt_CR551) that it may go well with you and with your children after you forever, when you do what is good and right in the sight of the L**ORD** your God.

**29**  “When [†](#Dt_CR552) the L**ORD** your God cuts off before you the nations whom you go in to dispossess, and you dispossess them and dwell in their land,

**30**  take care [†](#Dt_CR553) that you be not ensnared to follow them, after they have been destroyed before you, and that you do not inquire about their gods, saying, ‘How did these nations serve their gods?—that I also may do the same.’

**31** [✞] [†](#Dt_CR554) You shall not worship the L**ORD** your God in that way, for every [†](#Dt_CR555) abominable thing that the L**ORD** hates they have done for their gods, for [†](#Dt_CR556) they even burn their sons and their daughters in the fire to their gods.

**32** [✞] [*](#Dt_NB30) “Everything that I command you, you shall be careful to do. [†](#Dt_CR557) You shall not add to it or take from it.
