# STUDY NOTES FOR ECCLESIASTES 1


## ECCLESIASTES 1:1

This verse is the title to the book. Few books in the Bible have such titles; see Prov. 1:1.

## 1:1 Preacher.

Hb. qohelet (Introduction: Title). The text emphasizes the Preacher’s function as gatherer of the covenant community (Ex. 35:1) or as composer of proverbs (Eccl. 12:9) for the purpose of teaching. The Preacher addresses God’s people, not unbelievers.

## son of David.

See Introduction: Author.

## ECCLESIASTES 1:2

This verse states the theme of the book. Few books in the Bible have such an explicit statement of the book’s theme; see Prov. 1:7; Luke 1:1–4; John 20:30, 31.

## 1:2 Vanity.

The Hb. word translated “vanity,” which occurs thirty-eight times in Ecclesiastes, means “breath,” “vapor,” or “fleeting” and in the context of the book refers to that which is frustrating, temporary, or perplexing (Introduction: Characteristics and Themes). “Vanity of vanities” is a Hebrew way of expressing the superlative. The Preacher is here clearly using hyperbole to encourage the reader to face the vanity of life; elsewhere in the book, he commends finding satisfaction, the opposite of frustration in life, and presumes that the reader will understand and not be perplexed by his message.

## All.

This word is qualified by the phrase “under the sun” (v. 3) and means everything people experience with their senses (v. 8).

## ECCLESIASTES 1:3–11

These verses focus the reader’s attention on the frustrations of life and provide the first explanation of the meaning of “vanity.” Despite our engaging in all of life’s activity, we seem to get nowhere in the end. Although there may be some satisfaction in accomplishments, death can seem to make them meaningless because death comes to all, and our enjoyment of them seems to end at death. Only when one is rightly oriented to the Creator do we understand the true significance of our earthly lives (12:13, 14).

## 1:3 gain.

The idea that life’s labor is unprofitable, presented here as a rhetorical question, is stated directly in 2:11.

## under the sun.

This phrase, which occurs twenty-six times in Ecclesiastes, is synonymous with “under heaven” and “on earth” and refers to life as adversely affected by the fall (Introduction: Characteristics and Themes). Paul’s equivalent is “the present evil age” (Gal. 1:4). From the perspective of “under the sun,” life is often frustrating and perplexing. By contrast, from the perspective of the resurrection, life’s labor is not in vain (John 6:27–29; 1 Cor. 15:58).

## ECCLESIASTES 1:4 goes . . . comes.

People are constantly starting over (like the sun in v. 5), while by contrast, the earth (to which every person returns) abides.

## ECCLESIASTES 1:5 hastens.

The Hb. word (shoep) translated here as “hastens” means “to pant” (text note). The picture is that of the sun panting as it circles the earth, only to repeat the process day after day—a picture of exhausting, frustrating activity.

## ECCLESIASTES 1:6 around and around.

An image that communicates the same idea as the Preacher’s recurrent refrain “striving after wind,” both of which speak of the frustrations of life.

## ECCLESIASTES 1:7 is not full.

People’s experiences often fail to fill or satisfy them, just as waters never fill the sea; hence, life can be frustrating.

## ECCLESIASTES 1:8 eye is not satisfied.

The lack of satisfaction articulates the theme of frustration—always wanting more and never having enough.

## ECCLESIASTES 1:9 nothing new.

Cultural endeavors cannot reverse the futile and frustrating process of repeating what has already been done, because all die and their works are forgotten by humanity.

## under the sun.

See note on 1:3. The Preacher reminds the reader that this present life is the sphere of frustration.

## ECCLESIASTES 1:11 no remembrance.

No remembrance is a curse (Ps. 83:4; Jer. 11:19), and on this frustrating note the first section comes to a close.

## ECCLESIASTES 1:12–6:9

In this first half of the Preacher’s monologue or autobiography, he rehearses his search for escape from the vanity of life.

## 1:12–18

Continuing the theme of life’s frustrations and introducing the related theme of life’s perplexities, these verses show how the Preacher began his search for escape.

## 1:12 king . . . in Jerusalem.

See Introduction: Author. If anyone could find satisfaction and meaning in life, a king could. But not even a king can escape the vanity, the fleeting and perplexing nature of life.

## ECCLESIASTES 1:13 by wisdom.

Even wisdom, as wonderful and beneficial as it is, cannot totally protect people from the vanity of life (8:17). Life is at times frustrating and perplexing even for the wise.

## unhappy business.

Human existence includes divinely imposed burdens (Gen. 3:16–19; Rom. 8:22, 23). Jesus makes them bearable (Matt. 11:28–30).

## God.

Hb. Elohim. This term for God focuses on His transcendence and fits with the universal scope and application of the book’s teaching (12:13, 14). God’s personal covenant name (Hb. Yahweh, conventionally rendered “Lord”) is not used in this book. The forty occurrences of “God” in the book underscore the fact that God is very much involved in life, even in its apparent vanity.

## 1:13, 14 under heaven . . . under the sun.

See note on 1:3. God is active in this world as it has been adversely affected by the fall, but God is not subject to the vanity of life, as He is “in heaven” (5:2), not “under heaven.”

## 1:14 I have seen everything.

The Preacher uses hyperbole to underscore the thorough extent of his knowledge. If anyone could have figured out life by now, it would have been the Preacher.

## vanity.

See note on 1:2. Even for the likes of the Preacher, life is frustrating and perplexing at times.

## striving after wind.

This image is used here and elsewhere (1:17; 2:11, 17, 26; 4:4, 6, 16; 6:9) for the frustrating experiences of life.

## ECCLESIASTES 1:15 crooked . . . lacking.

The failure to straighten is frustrating, and the failure to count is perplexing.

## ECCLESIASTES 1:16 all who were over Jerusalem.

Since only David ruled over Jerusalem before Solomon, many have questioned the Solomonic authorship of Ecclesiastes (Introduction: Author). If Solomon is indeed the author, this phrase would refer to the pre-Israelite kings of Jerusalem (e.g., Adoni-zedek; Josh. 10:1). In any case, the point being made is that even the Preacher in his lofty position could not figure out life.

## ECCLESIASTES 1:17 striving after the wind.

See note on 1:14.

## ECCLESIASTES 1:18 knowledge . . . sorrow.

Ironically, wisdom can at times add to the frustration of life. The more one knows, the worse off one can be; ignorance can be bliss. If even the king with all his resources could not escape the vanity of life, ordinary folk should not be surprised if they cannot escape either.

# STUDY NOTES FOR ECCLESIASTES 2


## ECCLESIASTES 2:1–11

These verses focus on the pleasures of life, as indicated by the repetition of “pleasure” at the beginning (v. 1) and the end (v. 10). Can pleasure solve the problem of the vanity of life? No; even the pleasures of earthly accomplishments are ultimately unsatisfying for the Preacher (1 Kin. 4–11).

## 2:1 pleasure.

Hb. simchah here refers to a state of happiness, with a focus on senses.

## enjoy yourself.

Lit. “see good,” an expression associated with satisfaction in life (see 2:24, where the expression is translated “find enjoyment”; see also 3:13; 5:18; 6:6).

## vanity.

See note on 1:2. Pleasure, although good, is not an absolute antidote for the vanity of life.

## ECCLESIASTES 2:3 cheer . . . wine.

“Wine . . . cheers God and men” (Judg. 9:13) and has the power “to gladden the heart of man” (Ps. 104:15).

## my heart still guiding me with wisdom.

To determine what was good for people to do, the Preacher investigated life without forgetting the protective guidance of God’s wisdom. This thought is repeated near the end of this section, “my wisdom remained with me” (v. 9).

## ECCLESIASTES 2:4–9 I made great works . . . I became great.

In this subsection of 2:1–11, the Preacher tells the reader that he engaged in many building projects to escape the vanity of life. Building projects were a sign of blessing over a king’s reign (2 Chr. 14:7).

## 2:4 houses . . . vineyards.

Houses and vineyards were blessings of the covenant (Deut. 6:11; Is. 65:21; Jer. 32:15).

## ECCLESIASTES 2:5 gardens . . . fruit trees.

The language is reminiscent of the garden of Eden (Gen. 2:9) and emphasizes the magnificence of the Preacher’s building projects.

## ECCLESIASTES 2:6 to water . . . growing.

The Hebrew word for “to water” is found in Gen. 2:6, 10, and the word for “growing” is found in Gen. 2:9, evoking Edenic imagery.

## ECCLESIASTES 2:7 slaves . . . herds . . . flocks.

Covenant blessings; cf. Gen. 12:16; 20:14; 24:35.

## any who had been before me in Jerusalem.

See v. 9. Since only David was king in Jerusalem before Solomon, such a saying from Solomon seems odd. Regardless, the point is that the Preacher was in a better position than anyone to escape the vanity of life through pleasure.

## ECCLESIASTES 2:9 my wisdom.

See 2:3.

## ECCLESIASTES 2:10 pleasure . . . pleasure.

See 2:1.

## ECCLESIASTES 2:11 vanity.

See note on 1:2. Pleasure cannot protect from the vanity of life.

## striving after wind.

See note on 1:14.

## under the sun.

See note on 1:3. The Preacher experienced pleasure in life but failed to achieve the satisfaction of producing anything of ultimate value.

## ECCLESIASTES 2:12–17

These verses teach that wisdom offers a temporary benefit over folly, but death seems to negate that benefit in the end.

## 2:12 So I turned to consider wisdom.

The Preacher now moves to the role of wisdom in his search to escape the vanity of life.

## ECCLESIASTES 2:13 more gain in wisdom.

Wisdom is better than folly, as it is better to walk in light than in darkness.

## ECCLESIASTES 2:14 the same event.

Death (see 2:16).

## ECCLESIASTES 2:15 wise.

Wisdom’s advantages appear to be compromised because they cannot keep the wise from the abyss of death.

## vanity.

See note on 1:2. Life can be frustrating and perplexing even for the wise, and the fact that both the wise and the foolish die adds to the frustration and perplexity.

## ECCLESIASTES 2:16 no . . . remembrance.

The Preacher again mentions the curse of no remembrance (see 1:11 and Ps. 83:4; Jer. 11:19).

## ECCLESIASTES 2:17 hated.

Concluding that the curse of death erases the profit of wise labor, the Preacher comes to hate life in this present evil age.

## under the sun . . . vanity.

See notes on 1:2, 3. The Preacher views death as the ultimate source of frustration and perplexity.

## striving after wind.

See note on 1:14.

## ECCLESIASTES 2:18–26

Closely connected to the preceding discussion of death is the prospect of working hard in life only to have a fool inherit one’s wealth at death (vv. 18, 19). This thought leads the Preacher to the brink of despair (v. 20) and, ironically, to the commendation of joy and satisfaction in this life (vv. 24–26).

## 2:18 I hated.

The verb links this section to the preceding one, which ends with “So I hated” (v. 17).

## ECCLESIASTES 2:19 who knows.

One’s wealth may go to a wise person or to a fool, a prospect that frustrates and perplexes the Preacher.

## ECCLESIASTES 2:20 despair.

The Preacher feels like giving up at this point. For other occurrences of this word, see 1 Sam. 27:1; Job 6:26; Is. 57:10; Jer. 2:25; 18:12.

## ECCLESIASTES 2:21 evil.

Not a moral evil but a travesty.

## ECCLESIASTES 2:23 all his days.

Hyperbole, as in Ps. 90, where Moses says that the best of our years “are but trouble and sorrow” (v. 10) but then prays, “Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love” (v. 14), and, “Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us” (v. 15). If God answers prayer by granting joy and satisfaction, then all our days are not trouble and sorrow.

## ECCLESIASTES 2:24 eat and drink . . . enjoyment.

“Eat and drink” is a metaphor used elsewhere in Ecclesiastes for experiencing satisfaction in life (3:13; 5:18; 8:15; 9:7). As Moses prayed for joy and satisfaction in the midst of dark times (Ps. 90:14, 15), so the Preacher commends joy and satisfaction despite the vanity of life. Since there is at least some joy and satisfaction in life, “all is vanity” must be hyperbole (1:2 note; Introduction: Characteristics and Themes).

## ECCLESIASTES 2:25 apart from him.

God is the ultimate source of whatever joy and satisfaction are experienced in life (7:14).

## ECCLESIASTES 2:26 to the one who pleases him . . . sinner.

However great the temporary prosperity of the wicked, those who please God are at last the beneficiaries of God’s blessings. Even in this life, which is characterized by frustration and perplexity, joy can be experienced.

## vanity.

See note on 1:2. Joy and satisfaction are not an absolute antidote to the vanity of life.

## striving after wind.

See note on 1:14.

# STUDY NOTES FOR ECCLESIASTES 3


## ECCLESIASTES 3:1–8

Lists the good times in life (7:14), and there are many to be enjoyed. But each good time has its corresponding bad time, which brings frustration and perplexity.

## 3:1 time.

The truly wise know that all their “times” are in God’s hand (Ps. 31:15) and that there is an appropriate time for every human activity.

## matter.

While the Hb. term often refers to that which is pleasing (5:4; 12:1, 10), here, as elsewhere in the book (3:17; 5:8; 8:6), the word is used in a neutral sense, captured well with the word “”

## ECCLESIASTES 3:2 born . . . die.

This first pair is all encompassing: from beginning to end.

## ECCLESIASTES 3:8 peace.

The last pair ends with Hb. shalom, signifying wholeness in all areas of life.

## ECCLESIASTES 3:9–15

These verses continue the theme of “time” (3:1, 11) developed in 3:1–8 and focus on the perplexities and frustrations of life while bringing in the themes of joy and satisfaction.

## 3:9 gain.

This rhetorical question was asked earlier (1:3). “Nothing” is the implied answer; a frustrating state of affairs.

## ECCLESIASTES 3:11 beautiful.

The sense is “appropriate” (see 3:1). This same word is translated “fitting” in 5:18.

## eternity.

The Hb. term is translated “forever” in v. 14 and explained in v. 11 as “from the beginning to the end.” The heart knows that history is not meaningless but is perplexed in its efforts to discern the pattern of events.

## ECCLESIASTES 3:12 joyful.

The Preacher again commends finding joy in life (2:24–26).

## ECCLESIASTES 3:13 eat and drink.

The Preacher’s major application is his repeated advice (2:24–26; 3:12, 22; 5:18–20; 8:15) and command (9:7–10) to find joy and satisfaction in what God has ordained for one’s life (Introduction: Characteristics and Themes; 1 Cor. 7:20; 1 Tim. 6:8).

## ECCLESIASTES 3:14 fear.

Knowing, honoring, trusting, and obeying God (Introduction to the Wisdom Literature; Ex. 34:8; Is. 6:5; Luke 5:8; Rev. 1:17).

## ECCLESIASTES 3:15 driven away.

The sense of the verb here probably refers to the past, but the meaning of this last line in the verse is not clear.

## ECCLESIASTES 3:16–22

These verses continue the theme of “time” (3:1, 11, 17) developed in 3:1–15 and add the themes of injustice and divine judgment, with the latter playing a key role in the conclusion of the book (12:13, 14).

## 3:16 under the sun.

See note on 1:3. The Preacher begins this section by reminding us of the context of the discussion: the world has been adversely affected by the fall.

## justice.

The injustices of life make no sense to the Preacher, and he seems powerless to rectify them.

## ECCLESIASTES 3:17 the righteous and the wicked.

As punishment for sin, people, like animals (vv. 18–20), must die (Gen. 3:19). Nevertheless, the distinction between the righteous and the wicked is not removed by death but will be revealed at God’s judgment.

## time.

God ordains whatever occurs on earth (vv. 1–8). He has also appointed a day for judging the deeds of all (the “day of the LORD”; Joel 3:14).

## ECCLESIASTES 3:19 vanity.

See note on 1:2.

## ECCLESIASTES 3:20 to one place.

That is, the grave (cf. 6:6).

## ECCLESIASTES 3:21 Who knows whether the spirit of man.

Elsewhere the Preacher observes that though the physical body returns to dust, the spirit returns to God (12:7).

## ECCLESIASTES 3:22 nothing better.

The Preacher again commends finding joy and satisfaction in life where and when one can (2:24; 3:12; Introduction: Characteristics and Themes).

# STUDY NOTES FOR ECCLESIASTES 4


## ECCLESIASTES 4:1–3

These verses follow up the theme of injustice with the related theme of oppression.

## 4:1, 3 under the sun.

See note on 1:3. Another result of the fall is oppression.

## 4:1 power.

The Preacher complains that the oppressors have all the power.

## ECCLESIASTES 4:2, 3 more fortunate . . . better than both.

Viewing the plight of the oppressed, the Preacher concludes that the dead and unborn are better off.

## ECCLESIASTES 4:4–6

These verses teach that contentment is better than the turmoil of envy.

## 4:4 vanity.

See note on 1:2.

## striving after wind.

See note on 1:14.

## ECCLESIASTES 4:6 quietness.

Notwithstanding his previous dark thoughts, the Preacher does conclude that sufficiency with contentment is better than need resulting from laziness (v. 5) or excess accompanied by restless toil (vv. 6, 8).

## striving after the wind.

See note on 1:14.

## ECCLESIASTES 4:7, 8

These verses focus on the futility of labor without community.

## 4:7 vanity.

See note on 1:2.

## under the sun.

See note on 1:3.

## ECCLESIASTES 4:9–12

These verses continue the theme of community but from the positive perspective of the benefits that community affords.

## 4:9 Two are better than one.

Companionship rather than solitary labor is most beneficial.

## ECCLESIASTES 4:10 one will lift.

Companionship benefits those who find themselves in need.

## ECCLESIASTES 4:11 lie together.

Probably refers to companions on a journey rather than to husband and wife.

## ECCLESIASTES 4:12 prevail.

Companionship benefits those who find themselves opposed.

## threefold cord.

The logic of this concluding proverb is that if two are good, as in the examples in vv. 9–12, then three are even better. Community has benefits.

## ECCLESIASTES 4:13–16

These verses teach that wisdom is better than wealth or folly, but even wisdom’s benefits have their limits.

## 4:13 Better.

Links this section to the previous one (v. 9). Wisdom is better than wealth and folly.

## ECCLESIASTES 4:15, 16 under the sun . . . all the people.

See note on 1:3. Under the sun is the sphere of all humans.

## 4:16 will not rejoice.

Discontented people do not appreciate good leaders, a thought that brings the Preacher back to his theme of the apparent futility of life. Similarly, the Preacher will later bemoan the fact that a wise deliverer is not long remembered (9:15).

## striving after the wind.

See note on 1:14.


---

# STUDY NOTES FOR ECCLESIASTES 5


## ECCLESIASTES 5:1–7

These verses focus on the need to be mindful of the words we speak in the presence of God and point to the concluding message of the book, which is the fear of the Lord (12:13).

## 5:1 house of God.

This verse provides the context for the following verses: speech in the presence of God.

## the sacrifice of fools.

Contrasted with “listen,” the “sacrifice” seems to refer to speech in the temple.

## ECCLESIASTES 5:2 mouth.

The thoughts of the heart are expressed in the words of the mouth. God will judge them (Matt. 12:34–37).

## ECCLESIASTES 5:4, 5 vow.

A particular promise made to God (Deut. 23:21–23).

## ECCLESIASTES 5:6 mouth.

See note on v. 2.

## messenger.

This Hb. word can also be translated “angel” but here probably refers to a priest serving in the temple (Mal. 2:7).

## ECCLESIASTES 5:7 vanity.

See note on 1:2.

## 5:7 God . . . fear.

The Preacher sets forth the basis for the conclusion of the book (see 12:13).

## ECCLESIASTES 5:8, 9

These verses return to and expand on the themes of oppression (4:1–3) and injustice (3:16, 17).

## 5:8 do not be amazed.

Oppression and injustice from the layers of bureaucracy in a society are inevitable (4:1–3).

## 5:9 king.

This verse is difficult (text note), but the sense seems to be that the king is served by the produce of the field, and, given the chain of oppression in v. 8, the power of oppression goes all the way to the very top. But this is not an entirely negative view of kingship, for to have a king even in an oppressive system is “gain for a land in every way.” The meaning is that orderly rule is better than the alternative of anarchy.

## ECCLESIASTES 5:10–6:9

An extended teaching on wealth that the Preacher uses to close his search for escape from the vanity of life.

## 5:10–12 loves money . . . Sweet is the sleep.

Here the Preacher contrasts the insatiable love of money with the contentment of honest labor (1 Tim. 6:6–10).

## 5:10 vanity.

See note on 1:2. The Preacher’s search began with vanity (1:14) and now ends with vanity.

## ECCLESIASTES 5:13–17

Here the Preacher ponders the tragedies of unused and lost wealth. Whatever is not lost in a bad venture must be left behind at death. Apart from an eternal perspective, earthly labor appears to be in vain.

## 5:13 under the sun.

See note on 1:3.

## ECCLESIASTES 5:15 naked.

In a similar vein, Job in his suffering said, “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return” (Job 1:21).

## ECCLESIASTES 5:16 toils for the wind.

A variant of “striving after the wind” (1:14 note).

## ECCLESIASTES 5:18–6:6

These verses teach that God sovereignly distributes wealth and the ability to enjoy it. To some He gives wealth and the ability to enjoy it (5:18–20) while to others He gives wealth but not the ability to enjoy it (6:1–6).

## 5:18 good.

God intends that people should enjoy the benefits of their work as a due reward of their labor.

## eat and drink.

See notes on 2:24; 3:13.

## under the sun.

See note on 1:3. Even in this world, which has been adversely affected by the fall, joy and satisfaction can be experienced.

## ECCLESIASTES 5:19 gift of God.

The ability to enjoy earthly labor comes not from stoic human strength but from God-given grace, granted to rich and poor alike (v. 12).


---

# STUDY NOTES FOR ECCLESIASTES 6


## ECCLESIASTES 6:1 under the sun.

See note on 1:3. What the Preacher sees here “under the sun” contrasts with what he just saw “under the sun” (5:18).

## ECCLESIASTES 6:2 God.

To some God gives wealth but not the ability to enjoy it.

## power to enjoy.

Involves control over the management of wealth, not merely pleasure derived from spending it.

## vanity.

See note on 1:2.

## ECCLESIASTES 6:3 his soul is not satisfied with life’s good things.

Discontentment with God’s abundant provision is a great tragedy.

## ECCLESIASTES 6:6 one place.

The grave. Those who live long in discontentment are more to be pitied than a stillborn child. The stillborn, at least, does not spend long years in the self-inflicted misery of ingratitude.

## ECCLESIASTES 6:7–9

These verses bring the Preacher’s search for escape from life’s vanity to a close on a note of frustration that results from always wanting more. Not even the good gifts of God can finally satisfy the soul. Ultimately, only the gift of God Himself can.

## 6:7 appetite is not satisfied.

Again, earthly labor by itself does not fill the emptiness of the soul (1:8).

## ECCLESIASTES 6:8 what does the poor man have.

Those, though poor, who know how to live effectively in the world avoid the discontentment of wandering, unsatisfied desires.

## ECCLESIASTES 6:9 vanity.

See note on 1:2.

## striving after wind.

See note on 1:14.

## ECCLESIASTES 6:10–12:7

In this second half of the Preacher’s monologue or autobiography, he offers advice based on his search for escape from the vanity of life detailed in 2:12–6:9. Instructional imperatives in the second half outnumber those in the first half by five to one.

## 6:10–12

These verses focus on the perplexity of life.

## 6:10 one stronger than he.

An obvious reference to God. God’s sovereignty is such that no one can challenge Him (Dan. 4:35).

## ECCLESIASTES 6:12 who can tell.

The finite knowledge of humans is a recurrent theme and articulates our perplexity with life (3:11 note).

## under the sun.

See note on 1:3.

## vain.

See note on 1:2.

# STUDY NOTES FOR ECCLESIASTES 7


## ECCLESIASTES 7:1–13

Contains a series of proverbs that focus on death and the contrast between wisdom and folly. These proverbs tend toward hyperbole to make their point powerfully, e.g., in their commendation of sorrow, since elsewhere the Preacher commends joy (2:24; 3:12, 22).

## 7:1 day of death.

A negative comment from the perspective of “under the sun.” From the perspective of the resurrection, death is truly “far better” (Phil. 1:23).

## ECCLESIASTES 7:2, 4 house of mourning.

A funeral provides an indispensable perspective on the universally terminal condition. (These verses must be balanced with the commendation of eating and drinking for joy and satisfaction, as in 2:24; 3:12, 22.)

## ECCLESIASTES 7:3 laughter.

Laughter is usually viewed negatively in Ecclesiastes (2:2; see also 7:6) but not always (10:19). Cf. “a time to laugh” in 3:4.

## ECCLESIASTES 7:6 vanity.

See note on 1:2.

## ECCLESIASTES 7:7 oppression . . . a bribe.

These common experiences may threaten to destabilize an otherwise good spiritual condition (4:1–3).

## ECCLESIASTES 7:9 anger lodges.

If unquenched, the anger ignited by life’s frustrations leads to folly.

## ECCLESIASTES 7:11, 12 Wisdom . . . preserves the life.

True wisdom gives benefits in this life (cf. 8:8) and the life to come. Christ is the redemptive wisdom of God (1 Cor. 1:30), making wisdom accessible to sinners.

## ECCLESIASTES 7:13 who can make straight.

God’s decrees cannot be reversed. The negative effects of the fall will not be fully negated until the consummation.

## ECCLESIASTES 7:14–8:1

These verses remind us that while wisdom and righteousness bring benefit in this present age, they do not eliminate the frustrating and perplexing side of life.

## 7:14 prosperity . . . adversity.

Rejoicing in prosperity is commended, as is the realization that God also decrees adversity.

## man may not find out anything.

See notes on 3:11; 6:12.

## ECCLESIASTES 7:15 righteous . . . wicked.

The question implied by this observation is formulated in Jer. 12:1 (“Why does the way of the wicked prosper?”) and handled at more length in Pss. 37; 73.

## ECCLESIASTES 7:16, 17 Be not overly righteous . . . overly wicked.

The Preacher emphasizes the corruption of human nature. “Madness” refers to a delusional lack of understanding.

# STUDY NOTES FOR ECCLESIASTES 10


## ECCLESIASTES 10:1–4

Four proverbs that contrast wisdom and folly.

## ECCLESIASTES 10:2 right . . . left.

This pair had the conventional meanings of good and bad, or blessing and cursing, in the ancient world.

## ECCLESIASTES 10:4 calmness.

For other occurrences of the underlying Hb. term, see “tranquil” in Prov. 14:30 and “gentle” in Prov. 15:4.

Focuses on the irony of folly.

## 10:5 under the sun.

These verses teach the positive and negative aspects of life under a king, the beginning and end being marked by the word “king” (vv. 16, 20). The text alternates between the negative (v. 16, 18, 20) and the positive (v. 17, 19).

See Prov. 31:4, 5.

## ECCLESIASTES 11:1–6

These verses teach the benefits and uncertainty of human industry.

See notes on 3:11; 6:12.

## ECCLESIASTES 11:7–12:7

# STUDY NOTES FOR ECCLESIASTES 12


## ECCLESIASTES 12:1–7

The Preacher’s comments on aging and death, using the extended metaphor of a house that is falling down. He contrasts the deterioration of the house with the permanence of nature. It is best to take the metaphors here for their overall effect rather than speculate on the meaning of each individual figure. As the following notes indicate, some associations are clearer than others.

## 12:1 Remember.

Living life to the fullest (11:7–10) includes living in relation to the Creator.

## evil days.

If God is forgotten in youth, pleasure will be unknown in later years.

## ECCLESIASTES 12:3 keepers of the house.

The phrases here probably refer to parts of the body as members of a household.

## ECCLESIASTES 12:5 the almond tree blossoms.

Their white color is associated with the hair of the aged.

## eternal home.

Refers not just to the grave but also to the presence of one’s Creator and Judge (v. 7).

## ECCLESIASTES 12:6 golden bowl.

Describes a lamp broken in a fall that was caused by a break in a silver chain. Broken vessels and severed cords suggest the frailty that comes with aging.

## ECCLESIASTES 12:7 the spirit returns.

Human existence continues beyond death.

## ECCLESIASTES 12:8–14

These verses form the epilogue of the book. Verse 8 repeats 1:2 and signals the beginning of the conclusion, as does the return of references to the Preacher in the third person. “Fear God and keep his commandments” (v. 13) is the moral compass in all of life’s perplexities, frustrations, joys, and satisfactions.

## 12:8 Vanity.

See note on 1:2. A final reiteration of the Preacher’s refrain.

## ECCLESIASTES 12:9 wise . . . taught . . . studying . . . arranging.

In addition to being wise, the Preacher was an excellent teacher, student, and scholar.

## ECCLESIASTES 12:10 delight . . . truth.

The Preacher was concerned not only with truth but also with beauty in communicating the truth.

## ECCLESIASTES 12:11 given by one Shepherd.

The words of Ecclesiastes are God-breathed (2 Tim. 3:16).

## ECCLESIASTES 12:13 end of the matter.

To fear God is the logical conclusion drawn from the body of the book; the Preacher lays the basis for this conclusion at numerous points (3:14; 5:7; 8:12). Loyal submission to the rule of God is the central and summary admonition of the Bible’s Wisdom Literature (Job 28:28; Prov. 1:7; 9:10). See Introduction to the Wisdom Literature.

## the whole duty of man.

Perhaps better translated as “the duty of everyone.” For the same Hb. expression translated “everyone,” see 3:13; 5:19.

## ECCLESIASTES 12:14 judgment.

God’s judgment of thoughts and deeds is a dominant theme throughout the book (3:17; 8:12, 13; 11:9; 2 Cor. 5:10).
