## HUMAN BEINGS CREATED IN THE IMAGE OF GOD

I n art, the making of images is an exercise of beauty. Painting, sculpture, and the like are often imitative. Through our craft we depict objects drawn from real life.

The ultimate artist is God. When He fashioned the universe, He left His own mark upon it in such a way that the heavens declare His glory and the firmament shows forth His handiwork.

When God made the creatures that filled the earth and the sea, He created one creature to be uniquely made in His own image. Gen. 1:26-27 declares:

Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.” So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.

That the Bible says we are created in the image and likeness of God has led some to conclude that there is a difference between being in the image and being in the likeness of God. But the structure of the biblical language indicates that image and likeness refer to the same thing. We are the icons of God, creatures made with a unique capacity to mirror and reflect the character of God.

Being made in the image of God is usually understood to point to the sense in which we are like God. Though He is the Creator and we are creatures, and though God transcends us in being, power, and glory, nevertheless there is some sense in which we are like Him. There is some analogy between God and us. God is an intelligent and moral being. We are also moral agents equipped with a mind, a heart, and a will. These faculties make it possible for us to mirror God’s holiness, which was our original vocation.

The term _man_ , when used in such Scripture passages as “God created man in his own image” (Gen. 1:27), means “humankind.” Both male and female of the human species are made in the image of God. Part of the image includes mankind’s call to rule the earth, to have dominion over it. We are called to dress, fill, and keep the earth as God’s vice-regents. Here we are called to reflect the character of God’s righteous rule over the universe. He never ravages or exploits what He rules, but rather reigns in justice and kindness.

In the fall of mankind, something ghastly happened. The image of God was severely tarnished. Our ability to mirror His holiness has been greatly affected so that now the mirror is fogged.

The Fall, however, did not destroy our humanity. Though our ability to reflect God’s holiness was lost in the Fall, we are still human. We still have a mind, a heart, and a will. We still bear the mark of our Creator upon ourselves. The restoration of the fullness of the image of God in human beings is accomplished by Christ. He is, as the author of Hebrews declares, “the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature” (Heb. 1:3).

## COVENANT OF WORKS

W hen Adam and Eve were created, they stood in a moral relationship with God, their Creator. They possessed a duty of obedience to Him without any inherent claim to reward or blessing for such obedience. In His love, mercy, and grace, however, God voluntarily entered into a covenant with His creatures by which He added a promise of blessing to His law. This was not a covenant of equal partners, but one that rested on God’s initiative and His divine authority.

The original covenant between God and humankind was a covenant of works. In this covenant, God required perfect and total obedience to His rule. He promised eternal life as the blessing of obedience, but threatened mankind with death for disobeying God’s law. All human beings from Adam to the present are inescapably members of this covenant. People may refuse to obey or even acknowledge the existence of such a covenant, but they can never escape it. All human beings are in a covenant relationship to God, either as covenant breakers or covenant keepers. The covenant of works is the basis of our need of redemption (because we have violated it) and our hope of redemption (because Christ has fulfilled its terms for us).

A single sin is enough to violate the covenant of works and make us debtors who cannot pay our own debt to God. That we, after even a single sin, have any hope of redemption is due to God’s grace and God’s grace alone.

The rewards we will receive from God in heaven are also acts of grace. They are God’s crowning of His own gracious gifts. Had Adam been obedient to God’s covenant of works, he would only have achieved the merit that comes by virtue of fulfilling the covenant agreement with God. Because Adam fell into sin, God, in His mercy, added a new covenant of grace by which salvation became possible and actual.

Only one human being has ever kept the covenant of works. That person was Jesus. His work as the second or new Adam fulfilled all the terms of our original covenant with God. His merit in achieving this is available to all who put their trust in Him.

Jesus is the first person to get into heaven by His good works. We also get into heaven by good works—the good works of Jesus. They become “our” good works when we receive Christ by faith. When we put our faith in Christ, God credits the good works of Christ to our account. The covenant of grace fulfills the covenant of works because God graciously applies the merit of Christ to our account. Thus by grace we meet the terms set forth in the covenant of works.

## ORIGINAL SIN

I t is commonplace to hear the statement, “people are basically good.” Though it is admitted that no one is perfect, human wickedness is minimized. Yet if people are basically good, why is sin so universal?

It is often suggested that everybody sins because society has such a negative influence upon us. The problem is seen with our environment, not with our nature. This explanation for the universality of sin raises the question, how did society become corrupt in the first place? If people are born good or innocent, we would expect at least a percentage of them to remain good and sinless. We should be able to find societies that are not corrupt, where the environment has been conditioned by sinlessness rather than sinfulness. Yet the most dedicated-to-righteousness communes we can find still have provisions for dealing with the guilt of sin.

Since the fruit is universally corrupt we look for the root of the problem in the tree. Jesus indicated that a good tree does not produce corrupt fruit. The Bible clearly teaches that our original parents, Adam and Eve, fell in sin. Subsequently, every human being has been born with a sinful and corrupt nature. If the Bible didn’t explicitly teach this, we would have to deduce it rationally from the bare fact of the universality of sin.

Yet the Fall is not simply a question of rational deduction. It is a point of divine revelation. It refers to what we call original sin. Original sin does not refer primarily to the first or original sin committed by Adam and Eve. Original sin refers to the result of the first sin—the corruption of the human race. Original sin refers to the fallen condition in which we are born.

That the Fall occurred is clear in Scripture. The Fall was devastating. How it came to pass is open to dispute even among Reformed thinkers. The Westminster Confession explains the event simply, much in the manner that Scripture explains it:

Thus, the Fall occurred. The results, however, reached far beyond Adam and Eve. They not only touched all mankind, but decimated all mankind. We are sinners in Adam. We cannot ask, “When does the individual become a sinner?” For the truth is that human beings come into existence in a state of sinfulness. They are seen by God as sinful because of their solidarity with Adam.

The Westminster Confession again elegantly expresses the results of the Fall, particularly as it relates to human beings:

That last phrase is crucial. We are sinners not because we sin. Rather, we sin because we are sinners. Thus David laments, “Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me” (Ps. 51:5).

### The Creation of the World

1 [✞] In the [†](#Gn_CR1) beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

**2** [✞] The earth was [†](#Gn_CR2) without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.

**3** [✞] And God said, [†](#Gn_CR3) “Let there be light,” and there was light.

**4** [✞] And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light from the darkness.

**5** [✞] God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.

**6** [✞] And God said, [†](#Gn_CR4) “Let there be an expanse [*](#Gn_NC1) in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.”

**7**  And God made [*](#Gn_NC2) the expanse and [†](#Gn_CR5) separated the waters that were under the expanse from the waters that were [†](#Gn_CR6) above the expanse. And it was so.

**8**  And God called the expanse Heaven. [*](#Gn_NC3) And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.

**9**  And God said, [†](#Gn_CR7) “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so.

**10** [✞] God called the dry land Earth, [*](#Gn_NC4) and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.

**11** [✞] And God said,[†](#Gn_CR8) “Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants [*](#Gn_NC5) yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, on the earth.” And it was so.

**12**  The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.

**13**  And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.

**14** [✞] And God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night. And let them be for [†](#Gn_CR9) signs and for [†](#Gn_CR10) seasons, [*](#Gn_NC6) and for days and years,

**15**  and let them be lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth.” And it was so.

**16** [✞] And God [†](#Gn_CR11) made the two great lights—the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night—and the stars.

**17**  And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth,

**18**  to [†](#Gn_CR12) rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.

**19**  And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.

**20**  And God said, “Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds [*](#Gn_NC7) fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens.”

**21** [✞] So [†](#Gn_CR13) God created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.

**22** [✞] And God blessed them, saying, [†](#Gn_CR14) “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.”

**23**  And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.

**24** [✞] And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds—livestock and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so.

**25**  And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the livestock according to their kinds, and everything that creeps on the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.

**26** [✞] Then God said, [†](#Gn_CR15) “Let us make man [*](#Gn_NC8) in our image, [†](#Gn_CR16) after our likeness. And [†](#Gn_CR17) let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”

> **27** [✞] So God created man in his own image,

  > in the image of God he created him;

  > [†](#Gn_CR18) male and female he created them.

**28** [✞] And God blessed them. And God said to them, [†](#Gn_CR19) “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”

**29** [✞] And God said, “Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit. [†](#Gn_CR20) You shall have them for food.

**30**  And [†](#Gn_CR21) to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so.

**31**  [†](#Gn_CR22) And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.2 [✞] Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and [†](#Gn_CR23) all the host of them.

**2** [✞] And [†](#Gn_CR24) on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done.

**3** [✞] So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation.

> **4** [✞] [†](#Gn_CR25) These are the generations

> of the heavens and the earth when they were created,

**5** [✞] When no [†](#Gn_CR26) bush of the field [*](#Gn_NC9) was yet in the land [*](#Gn_NC10) and no small plant of the field had yet sprung up—for the L**ORD** God had not caused it to rain on the land, and there was no man [†](#Gn_CR27) to work the ground,

**6**  and a mist [*](#Gn_NC11) was going up from the land and was watering the whole face of the ground—

**7** [✞] then the L**ORD** God formed the man of [†](#Gn_CR28) dust from the ground and [†](#Gn_CR29) breathed into his [†](#Gn_CR30) nostrils the breath of life, and [†](#Gn_CR31) the man became a living creature.

**8** [✞] And the L**ORD** God planted a [†](#Gn_CR32) garden in Eden, in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed.

**9** [✞] And out of the ground the L**ORD** God made to spring up every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. [†](#Gn_CR33) The tree of life was in the midst of the garden, [†](#Gn_CR34) and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

**10** [✞] A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there it divided and became four rivers.

**11** [✞] The name of the first is the Pishon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of [†](#Gn_CR35) Havilah, where there is gold.

**12**  And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there.

**13**  The name of the second river is the Gihon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of Cush.

**14**  And the name of the third river is the [†](#Gn_CR36) Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.

**15** [✞] The L**ORD** God took the man [†](#Gn_CR37) and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.

**16** [✞] And the L**ORD** God commanded the man, saying, “You may surely eat of every tree of the garden,

**17** [✞] but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil [†](#Gn_CR38) you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat [*](#Gn_NC12) of it you [†](#Gn_CR39) shall surely die.”

**18** [✞] Then the L**ORD** God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; [†](#Gn_CR40) I will make him a helper fit for [*](#Gn_NC13) him.”

**19** [✞] [†](#Gn_CR41) Now out of the ground the L**ORD** God had formed [*](#Gn_NC14) every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens and [†](#Gn_CR42) brought them to the man to see what he would call them. And whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.

**20** [✞] The man gave names to all livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast of the field. But for Adam [*](#Gn_NC15) there was not found a helper fit for him.

**21** [✞] So the L**ORD** God caused a [†](#Gn_CR43) deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.

**22**  And the rib that the L**ORD** God had taken from the man he made [*](#Gn_NC16) into a woman and brought her to the man.

**23** [✞] Then the man said,

> “This at last is [†](#Gn_CR44) bone of my bones

  > and flesh of my flesh;

> she shall be called Woman,

  > because she was [†](#Gn_CR45) taken out of Man.” [*](#Gn_NC17)

3 [✞] Now [†](#Gn_CR47) the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the L**ORD** God had made.He said to the woman, “Did God actually say, ‘You [*](#Gn_NC18) shall not eat of any tree in the garden’?”

**2** [✞] And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden,

**3**  but God said, [†](#Gn_CR48) ‘You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.’”

**4**  [†](#Gn_CR49) But the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die.

**5** [✞] For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”

**6** [✞] So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, [*](#Gn_NC19) she took of its fruit [†](#Gn_CR50) and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, [†](#Gn_CR51) and he ate.

**7** [✞] [†](#Gn_CR52) Then the eyes of both were opened, [†](#Gn_CR53) and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths.

**8** [✞] And they heard the sound of the L**ORD** God walking in the garden in the cool [*](#Gn_NC20) of the day, and the man and his wife [†](#Gn_CR54) hid themselves from the presence of the L**ORD** God among the trees of the garden.

**9** [✞] But the L**ORD** God called to the man and said to him, “Where are you?” [*](#Gn_NC21)

**10**  And he said, “I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, [†](#Gn_CR55) because I was naked, and I hid myself.”

**11** [✞] He said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?”

**12** [✞] The man said, [†](#Gn_CR56) “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate.”

**13** [✞] Then the L**ORD** God said to the woman, “What is this that you have done?” The woman said, [†](#Gn_CR57) “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”

**14** [✞] The L**ORD** God said to the serpent,

> “Because you have done this,

  > cursed are you above all livestock

  > and above all beasts of the field;

> on your belly you shall go,

  > and [†](#Gn_CR58) dust you shall eat

  > all the days of your life.

> **15** [✞] I will put enmity between you and the woman,

  > and between your offspring [*](#Gn_NC22) and [†](#Gn_CR59) her offspring;

> [†](#Gn_CR60) he shall bruise your head,

  > and you shall bruise his heel.”

**16** [✞] To the woman he said,

> “I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing;

  > [†](#Gn_CR61) in pain you shall bring forth children.

> [†](#Gn_CR62) Your desire shall be contrary to [*](#Gn_NC23) your husband,

  > but he shall [†](#Gn_CR63) rule over you.”

**17** [✞] And to Adam he said,

> “Because you have listened to the voice of your wife

  > and have eaten of the tree

> [†](#Gn_CR64) of which I commanded you,

  > ‘You shall not eat of it,’

> [†](#Gn_CR65) cursed is the ground because of you;

  > [†](#Gn_CR66) in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life;

> **18**  thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you;

  > and you shall eat the plants of the field.

> **19** [✞] By the sweat of your face

  > you shall eat bread,

> till you return to the ground,

  > for out of it you were taken;

> [†](#Gn_CR67) for you are dust,

  > and [†](#Gn_CR68) to dust you shall return.”

**20** [✞] The man called his wife’s name Eve, because she was the mother of all living. [*](#Gn_NC24)

**21** [✞] And the L**ORD** God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins and clothed them.

**22** [✞] Then the L**ORD** God said, [†](#Gn_CR69) “Behold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand [†](#Gn_CR70) and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever—”

**23** [✞] therefore the L**ORD** God sent him out from the garden of Eden [†](#Gn_CR71) to work the ground from which he was taken.

**24** [✞] He drove out the man, and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the [†](#Gn_CR72) cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life.4 [✞] Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, “I have gotten [*](#Gn_NC25) a man with the help of the L**ORD**.”

**2** [✞] And again, she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a worker of the ground.

**3**  In the course of time Cain brought to the L**ORD** an offering of [†](#Gn_CR73) the fruit of the ground,

**4** [✞] and Abel also brought of [†](#Gn_CR74) the firstborn of his flock and of their fat portions. And the L**ORD** [†](#Gn_CR75) had regard for Abel and his offering,

**5** [✞] but [†](#Gn_CR76) for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his face fell.

**6** [✞] The L**ORD** said to Cain, “Why are you angry, and why has your face fallen?

**7** [✞] [†](#Gn_CR77) If you do well, will you not be accepted? [*](#Gn_NC26) And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door. [†](#Gn_CR78) Its desire is contrary to [*](#Gn_NC27) you, but you must rule over it.”

**8** [✞] Cain spoke to Abel his brother. [*](#Gn_NC28) And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and [†](#Gn_CR79) killed him.

**9** [✞] Then the L**ORD** said to Cain, “Where is Abel your brother?” He said, [†](#Gn_CR80) “I do not know; am I my brother’s keeper?”

**10** [✞] And the L**ORD** said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood [†](#Gn_CR81) is crying to me from the ground.

**11** [✞] And now [†](#Gn_CR82) you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.

**12**  When you work the ground, it shall no longer yield to you its strength. You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.”

**13** [✞] Cain said to the L**ORD**, “My [†](#Gn_CR83) punishment is greater than I can bear. [*](#Gn_NC29)

**14** [✞] Behold, [†](#Gn_CR84) you have driven me today away from the ground, and [†](#Gn_CR85) from your face I shall be hidden. I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, [†](#Gn_CR86) and whoever finds me will kill me.”

**15** [✞] Then the L**ORD** said to him, “Not so! If anyone kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him [†](#Gn_CR87) sevenfold.” And the L**ORD** [†](#Gn_CR88) put a mark on Cain, lest any who found him should attack him.

**16**  Then Cain went away from the presence of the L**ORD** and settled in the land of Nod, [*](#Gn_NC30) east of Eden.

**17** [✞] Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. When he built a city, he called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.

**18** [✞] To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech.

**19** [✞] And Lamech took two wives. The name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.

**20**  Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.

**21**  His brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe.

**22**  Zillah also bore Tubal-cain; he was the forger of all instruments of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.

**23**  Lamech said to his wives:

> “Adah and Zillah, hear my voice;

  > you wives of Lamech, listen to what I say:

> I have killed a man for wounding me,

  > a young man for striking me.

> **24** [✞] [†](#Gn_CR89) If Cain’s revenge is sevenfold,

  > then Lamech’s is seventy-sevenfold.”

**25** [✞] And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name Seth, for she said, “God has appointed [*](#Gn_NC31) for me another offspring instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.”

**26** [✞] To [†](#Gn_CR90) Seth also a son was born, and he called his name [†](#Gn_CR91) Enosh. At that time people began [†](#Gn_CR92) to call upon the name of the L**ORD**.5 [✞] This is the book of the generations of Adam. When God created man, [†](#Gn_CR93) he made him in the likeness of God.

**2** [✞] Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and named them Man [*](#Gn_NC32) when they were created.

**3** [✞] When Adam had lived 130 years, he fathered a son in his own likeness, after his image, and [†](#Gn_CR94) named him Seth.

**4**  [†](#Gn_CR95) The days of Adam after he fathered Seth were 800 years; and he had other sons and daughters.

**5** [✞] Thus all the days that Adam lived were 930 years, [†](#Gn_CR96) and he died.

**6**  When Seth had lived 105 years, [†](#Gn_CR97) he fathered Enosh.

**7**  Seth lived after he fathered Enosh 807 years and had other sons and daughters.

**8**  Thus all the days of Seth were 912 years, and he died.

**9**  When Enosh had lived 90 years, he fathered Kenan.

**10**  Enosh lived after he fathered Kenan 815 years and had other sons and daughters.

**11**  Thus all the days of Enosh were 905 years, and he died.

**12**  When Kenan had lived 70 years, he fathered Mahalalel.

**13**  Kenan lived after he fathered Mahalalel 840 years and had other sons and daughters.

**14**  Thus all the days of Kenan were 910 years, and he died.

**15**  When Mahalalel had lived 65 years, he fathered Jared.

**16**  Mahalalel lived after he fathered Jared 830 years and had other sons and daughters.

**17**  Thus all the days of Mahalalel were 895 years, and he died.

**18**  When Jared had lived 162 years, he fathered [†](#Gn_CR98) Enoch.

**19**  Jared lived after he fathered Enoch 800 years and had other sons and daughters.

**20**  Thus all the days of Jared were 962 years, and he died.

**21**  When Enoch had lived 65 years, he fathered Methuselah.

**22** [✞] Enoch [†](#Gn_CR99) walked with God [*](#Gn_NC33) after he fathered Methuselah 300 years and had other sons and daughters.

**23** [✞] Thus all the days of Enoch were 365 years.

**24** [✞] Enoch [†](#Gn_CR100) walked with God, and he was not, [*](#Gn_NC34) [†](#Gn_CR101) for God took him.

**25**  When Methuselah had lived 187 years, he fathered Lamech.

**26**  Methuselah lived after he fathered Lamech 782 years and had other sons and daughters.

**27**  Thus all the days of Methuselah were 969 years, and he died.

**28**  When Lamech had lived 182 years, he fathered a son

**29** [✞] and called his name Noah, saying, “Out of the ground [†](#Gn_CR102) that the L**ORD** has cursed, this one shall bring us relief [*](#Gn_NC35) from our work and from the painful toil of our hands.”

**30**  Lamech lived after he fathered Noah 595 years and had other sons and daughters.

**31**  Thus all the days of Lamech were 777 years, and he died.

**32** [✞] After Noah was 500 years old, Noah fathered [†](#Gn_CR103) Shem, Ham, and [†](#Gn_CR104) Japheth.6 [✞] When man began to multiply on the face of the land and daughters were born to them,

**2** [✞] the sons of God saw that the daughters of man were attractive. And they took as their wives any they chose.

**3** [✞] Then the L**ORD** said, [†](#Gn_CR105) “My Spirit shall not abide in [*](#Gn_NC36) man forever, [†](#Gn_CR106) for he is flesh: his days shall be 120 years.”

**4**  The Nephilim [*](#Gn_NC37) were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of man and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown.

**5** [✞] [†](#Gn_CR107) The L**ORD** saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every [†](#Gn_CR108) intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.

**6** [✞] And [†](#Gn_CR109) the L**ORD** regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it [†](#Gn_CR110) grieved him to his heart.

**7** [✞] So the L**ORD** said, “I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them.”

**8** [✞] But Noah [†](#Gn_CR111) found favor in the eyes of the L**ORD**.

**9** [✞] These are the generations of Noah. [†](#Gn_CR112) Noah was a righteous man, [†](#Gn_CR113) blameless in his generation. Noah [†](#Gn_CR114) walked with God.

**10**  And Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

**11**  Now the earth was corrupt in God’s sight, and the earth was filled with violence.

**12**  And God [†](#Gn_CR115) saw the earth, and behold, it was corrupt, [†](#Gn_CR116) for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth.

**13** [✞] And God said to Noah, [†](#Gn_CR117) “I have determined to make an end of all flesh, [*](#Gn_NC38) for the earth is filled with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them with the earth.

**14** [✞] Make yourself an ark of gopher wood. [*](#Gn_NC39) Make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and out with pitch.

**15** [✞] This is how you are to make it: the length of the ark 300 cubits, [*](#Gn_NC40) its breadth 50 cubits, and its height 30 cubits.

**16**  Make a roof [*](#Gn_NC41) for the ark, and finish it to a cubit above, and set the door of the ark in its side. Make it with lower, second, and third decks.

**17** [✞] [†](#Gn_CR118) For behold, I will bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life under heaven. Everything that is on the earth shall die.

**18** [✞] But [†](#Gn_CR119) I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you.

**19**  And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ark to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female.

**20** [✞] Of the birds according to their kinds, and of the animals according to their kinds, of every creeping thing of the ground, according to its kind, two of every sort shall come in to you to keep them alive.

**21**  Also take with you every sort of food that is eaten, and store it up. It shall serve as food for you and for them.”

**22** [✞] [†](#Gn_CR120) Noah did this; he did all that God commanded him.7 [✞] Then the L**ORD** said to Noah, [†](#Gn_CR121) “Go into the ark, you and all your household, for I have seen that [†](#Gn_CR122) you are righteous before me in this generation.

**2** [✞] Take with you seven pairs of all [†](#Gn_CR123) clean animals, [*](#Gn_NC42) the male and his mate, and a pair of the animals that are not clean, the male and his mate,

**3** [✞] and seven pairs [*](#Gn_NC43) of the birds of the heavens also, male and female, to keep their offspring alive on the face of all the earth.

**4** [✞] For in seven days [†](#Gn_CR124) I will send rain on the earth forty days and forty nights, [†](#Gn_CR125) and every living thing [*](#Gn_NC44) that I have made I will blot out from the face of the ground.”

**5** [✞] [†](#Gn_CR126) And Noah did all that the L**ORD** had commanded him.

**6** [✞] Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came upon the earth.

**7** [✞] And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with him went into the ark to escape the waters of the flood.

**8**  Of clean animals, and of animals that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creeps on the ground,

**9** [✞] two and two, male and female, went into the ark with Noah, as God had commanded Noah.

**10** [✞] And after seven days the waters of the flood came upon the earth.

**11** [✞] In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the [†](#Gn_CR127) fountains of the great deep burst forth, and [†](#Gn_CR128) the windows of the heavens were opened.

**12**  And rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights.

**13** [✞] On the very same day Noah and his sons, Shem and Ham and Japheth, and Noah’s wife and the three wives of his sons with them entered the ark,

**14**  they and every beast, according to its kind, and all the livestock according to their kinds, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, according to its kind, and every bird, according to its kind, every winged creature.

**15**  They [†](#Gn_CR129) went into the ark with Noah, two and two of all flesh in which there was the breath of life.

**16** [✞] And those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in [†](#Gn_CR130) as God had commanded him. And the L**ORD** shut him in.

**17** [✞] The flood [†](#Gn_CR131) continued forty days on the earth. The waters increased and bore up the ark, and it rose high above the earth.

**18** [✞] The waters prevailed and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the face of the waters.

**19**  And the waters prevailed so mightily on the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered.

**20** [✞] The waters prevailed above the mountains, covering them fifteen cubits [*](#Gn_NC45) deep.

**21** [✞] And [†](#Gn_CR132) all flesh died that moved on the earth, birds, livestock, beasts, all swarming creatures that swarm on the earth, and all mankind.

**22**  Everything on the dry land [†](#Gn_CR133) in whose nostrils was the breath of life died.

**23** [✞] He blotted out every living thing that was on the face of the ground, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens. They were blotted out from the earth. Only [†](#Gn_CR134) Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ark.

**24**  And the waters prevailed on the earth 150 days.8 [✞] But God [†](#Gn_CR135) remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the livestock that were with him in the ark. And [†](#Gn_CR136) God made a wind blow over the earth, and the waters subsided.

**2**  [†](#Gn_CR137) The fountains of the deep and fthe windows of the heavens were closed, the rain from the heavens was restrained,

**3**  and the waters receded from the earth continually. At the end [†](#Gn_CR138) of 150 days the waters had abated,

**4** [✞] and in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of [†](#Gn_CR139) Ararat.

**5**  And the waters continued to abate until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.

**6** [✞] At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made

**7**  and sent forth a raven. It went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth.

**8**  Then he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground.

**9**  But the dove found no place to set her foot, and she returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took her and brought her into the ark with him.

**10**  He waited another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark.

**11**  And the dove came back to him in the evening, and behold, in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth.

**12**  Then he waited another seven days and sent forth the dove, and she did not return to him anymore.

**13**  In the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried from off the earth. And Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dry.

**14**  In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth had dried out.

**15**  Then God said to Noah,

**16** [✞] “Go out from the ark, [†](#Gn_CR140) you and your wife, and your sons and your sons’ wives with you.

**17**  Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh—birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth—that they may swarm on the earth, and [†](#Gn_CR141) be fruitful and multiply on the earth.”

**18** [✞] So Noah went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with him.

**19**  Every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, went out by families from the ark.

**20** [✞] Then Noah built an altar to the L**ORD** and took some of every clean animal and some of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar.

**21** [✞] And when the L**ORD** smelled [†](#Gn_CR142) the pleasing aroma, the L**ORD** said in his heart, “I will never again [†](#Gn_CR143) curse [*](#Gn_NC46) the ground because of man, for [†](#Gn_CR144) the intention of man’s heart is evil from his youth. [†](#Gn_CR145) Neither will I ever again strike down every living creature as I have done.

**22** [✞] [†](#Gn_CR146) While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, [†](#Gn_CR147) day and night, shall not cease.”9 [✞] And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, [†](#Gn_CR148) “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.

**2** [✞] [†](#Gn_CR149) The fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every bird of the heavens, upon everything that creeps on the ground and all the fish of the sea. Into your hand they are delivered.

**3** [✞] [†](#Gn_CR150) Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. And [†](#Gn_CR151) as I gave you the green plants, I give you everything.

**4** [✞] But you shall not eat flesh with its [†](#Gn_CR152) life, that is, its blood.

**5** [✞] And for your lifeblood I will require a reckoning: [†](#Gn_CR153) from every beast I will require it and [†](#Gn_CR154) from man. From his fellow man I will require a reckoning for the life of man.

> **6** [✞] [†](#Gn_CR155) “Whoever sheds the blood of man,

  > by man shall his blood be shed,

**8**  Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him,

**9** [✞] “Behold, [†](#Gn_CR157) I establish my covenant with you and your offspring after you,

**10**  and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the livestock, and every beast of the earth with you, as many as came out of the ark; it is for every beast of the earth.

**11**  [†](#Gn_CR158) I establish my covenant with you, that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.”

**12** [✞] And God said, [†](#Gn_CR159) “This is the sign of the covenant that I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations:

**13**  I have set [†](#Gn_CR160) my bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.

**14**  When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds,

**15** [✞] [†](#Gn_CR161) I will remember my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh. And the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh.

**16** [✞] When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember [†](#Gn_CR162) the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.”

**17**  God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.”

**18** [✞] The sons of Noah who went forth from the ark were [†](#Gn_CR163) Shem, Ham, and Japheth. (Ham was the father of Canaan.)

**19**  These three were the sons of Noah, and [†](#Gn_CR164) from these the people of the whole earth were dispersed. [*](#Gn_NC48)

**20** [✞] Noah began to be a man of the soil, and he planted a vineyard. [*](#Gn_NC49)

**21** [✞] He drank of the wine and became drunk and lay uncovered in his tent.

**22** [✞] And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brothers outside.

**23**  Then Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid it on both their shoulders, and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were turned backward, and they did not see their father’s nakedness.

**24**  When Noah awoke from his wine [†](#Gn_CR165) and knew what his youngest son had done to him,

**25** [✞] he said,

> [†](#Gn_CR166) “Cursed be Canaan;

  > [†](#Gn_CR167) a servant of servants shall he be to his brothers.”

> “Blessed be the L**ORD**, the God of Shem;

  > and let Canaan be his servant.

> **27** [✞] May God enlarge Japheth, [*](#Gn_NC50)

  > and let him dwell in the tents of Shem,

  > and let Canaan be his servant.”

**28** [✞] After the flood Noah lived 350 years.

**29** [✞] All the days of Noah were 950 years, and he died.
