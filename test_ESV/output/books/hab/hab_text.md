### Habakkuk’s Complaint

1 [✞] [†](#Hbtext_EFN1) The oracle that Habakkuk the prophet saw.

> **2** [✞] O L**ORD**, [†](#Hbtext_EFN2) how long shall I cry for help,

  > and you will not hear?

> Or cry to you [†](#Hbtext_EFN3) “Violence!”

  > and you will not save?

> **3** [✞] [†](#Hbtext_EFN4) Why do you make me see iniquity,

  > and why do you idly look at wrong?

> Destruction [†](#Hbtext_EFN5) and violence are before me;

  > strife and contention arise.

> **4** [✞] [†](#Hbtext_EFN6) So the law is paralyzed,

  > and justice never goes forth.

> [†](#Hbtext_EFN7) For the wicked surround the righteous;

  > so justice goes forth perverted.

> **5** [✞] [†](#Hbtext_EFN8) “Look among the nations, and see;

  > wonder and be astounded.

> [†](#Hbtext_EFN9) For I am doing a work in your days

  > that you would not believe if told.

> **6** [✞] For behold, [†](#Hbtext_EFN10) I am raising up the Chaldeans,

  > that bitter and hasty nation,

> [†](#Hbtext_EFN11) who march through the breadth of the earth,

  > [†](#Hbtext_EFN12) to seize dwellings not their own.

> **7** [✞] They are dreaded and fearsome;

  > [†](#Hbtext_EFN13) their justice and dignity go forth from themselves.

> **8** [✞] [†](#Hbtext_EFN14) Their horses are swifter than leopards,

  > more fierce than [†](#Hbtext_EFN15) the evening wolves;

  > their horsemen press proudly on.

> Their horsemen come from afar;

  > [†](#Hbtext_EFN16) they fly like an eagle swift to devour.

> **9** [✞] They all come [†](#Hbtext_EFN17) for violence,

  > all their faces forward.

  > They gather captives [†](#Hbtext_EFN18) like sand.

> **10** [✞] At kings they scoff,

  > and at rulers they laugh.

> [†](#Hbtext_EFN19) They laugh at every fortress,

  > for [†](#Hbtext_EFN20) they pile up earth and take it.

> **11** [✞] Then they sweep by like the wind and go on,

  > [†](#Hbtext_EFN21) guilty men, [†](#Hbtext_EFN22) whose own might is their god!”

> **12** [✞] Are you not [†](#Hbtext_EFN23) from everlasting,

  > O L**ORD** my God, my Holy One?

  > [†](#Hbtext_EFN24) We shall not die.

> O L**ORD**, [†](#Hbtext_EFN25) you have ordained them as a judgment,

  > and you, O [†](#Hbtext_EFN26) Rock, have established them for reproof.

> **13** [✞] You who are [†](#Hbtext_EFN27) of purer eyes than to see evil

  > and cannot look at wrong,

> [†](#Hbtext_EFN28) why do you idly look at traitors

  > and [†](#Hbtext_EFN29) remain silent when the wicked swallows up

  > the man more righteous than he?

> **14** [✞] You make mankind like the fish of the sea,

  > like crawling things that have no ruler.

> **15**  [†](#Hbtext_EFN30) He [*](#Hb_NC1) brings all of them up [†](#Hbtext_EFN31) with a hook;

  > he drags them out with his net;

> he gathers them in his dragnet;

  > so he rejoices and is glad.

> **16** [✞] [†](#Hbtext_EFN32) Therefore he sacrifices to his net

  > and makes offerings to his dragnet;

> for by them he lives in luxury, [*](#Hb_NC2)

  > and his food is rich.

> **17**  Is he then to keep on emptying his net

  > [†](#Hbtext_EFN33) and mercilessly killing nations forever?

  > and station myself on the tower,

> and [†](#Hbtext_EFN35) look out to see [†](#Hbtext_EFN36) what he will say to me,

  > and what I will answer concerning my complaint.

**2** [✞] And the L**ORD** answered me:

> [†](#Hbtext_EFN37) “Write the vision;

  > make it plain on tablets,

  > so he may run who reads it.

> **3** [✞] For still [†](#Hbtext_EFN38) the vision awaits its appointed time;

  > it hastens to the end—it will not lie.

> If it seems slow, [†](#Hbtext_EFN39) wait for it;

  > [†](#Hbtext_EFN40) it will surely come; it will not delay.

> **4** [✞] “Behold, his soul is puffed up; it is not upright within him,

  > but [†](#Hbtext_EFN41) the righteous shall live by his faith. [*](#Hb_NC3)

> **5** [✞] “Moreover, wine [*](#Hb_NC4) is [†](#Hbtext_EFN42) a traitor,

  > an arrogant man who is never at rest. [*](#Hb_NC5)

> His greed is as wide as Sheol;

  > like death [†](#Hbtext_EFN43) he has never enough.

> [†](#Hbtext_EFN44) He gathers for himself all nations

  > and collects as his own all peoples.”

**6** [✞] Shall not all these [†](#Hbtext_EFN45) take up their taunt against him, with scoffing and riddles for him, and say,

> [†](#Hbtext_EFN46) “Woe to him [†](#Hbtext_EFN47) who heaps up what is not his own—

  > for [†](#Hbtext_EFN48) how long?—

  > and [†](#Hbtext_EFN49) loads himself with pledges!”

> **7**  [†](#Hbtext_EFN50) Will not your debtors suddenly arise,

  > and those awake who will make you tremble?

  > Then you will be spoil for them.

> **8** [✞] [†](#Hbtext_EFN51) Because you have plundered many nations,

  > all the remnant of the peoples shall plunder you,

> [†](#Hbtext_EFN52) for the blood of man and [†](#Hbtext_EFN51) violence to the earth,

  > to cities and all who dwell in them.

> **9** [✞] [†](#Hbtext_EFN53) “Woe to him who gets evil gain for his house,

  > [†](#Hbtext_EFN54) to [†](#Hbtext_EFN55) set his nest on high,

  > to be safe from the reach of harm!

> **10**  You have devised shame for your house

  > [†](#Hbtext_EFN56) by cutting off many peoples;

  > you have forfeited your life.

> **11** [✞] For [†](#Hbtext_EFN57) the stone will cry out from the wall,

  > and the beam from the woodwork respond.

> **12** [✞] [†](#Hbtext_EFN58) “Woe to him [†](#Hbtext_EFN59) who builds a town with blood

  > and founds a city on iniquity!

> **13** [✞] Behold, is it not from the L**ORD** of hosts

  > that [†](#Hbtext_EFN60) peoples labor merely for fire,

  > and nations weary themselves for nothing?

> **14** [✞] [†](#Hbtext_EFN61) For the earth will be filled

  > with the knowledge of [†](#Hbtext_EFN62) the glory of the L**ORD**

  > as the waters cover the sea.

> **15** [✞] [†](#Hbtext_EFN63) “Woe to him [†](#Hbtext_EFN64) who makes his neighbors drink—

  > you pour out your wrath and make them drunk,

  > in order to gaze [†](#Hbtext_EFN65) at their nakedness!

> **16** [✞] You will have your fill [†](#Hbtext_EFN66) of shame instead of glory.

  > [†](#Hbtext_EFN67) Drink, yourself, and show your uncircumcision!

> [†](#Hbtext_EFN67) The cup in the L**ORD**’s right hand

  > will come around to you,

  > and [†](#Hbtext_EFN68) utter shame will come upon your glory!

> **17** [✞] [†](#Hbtext_EFN69) The violence [†](#Hbtext_EFN70) done to Lebanon will overwhelm you,

  > as will the destruction of the beasts that terrified them,

> [†](#Hbtext_EFN69) for the blood of man and violence to the earth,

  > to cities and all who dwell in them.

> **18** [✞] [†](#Hbtext_EFN71) “What profit is an idol

  > when its maker has shaped it,

  > a metal image, [†](#Hbtext_EFN72) a teacher of lies?

> For its maker trusts in his own creation

  > when he makes [†](#Hbtext_EFN73) speechless idols!

> **19**  [†](#Hbtext_EFN74) Woe to him [†](#Hbtext_EFN75) who says to a wooden thing, Awake;

  > to a silent stone, Arise!

> Can this teach?

> Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver,

  > and [†](#Hbtext_EFN76) there is no breath at all in it.

> **20** [✞] But [†](#Hbtext_EFN77) the L**ORD** is in his holy temple;

  > [†](#Hbtext_EFN78) let all the earth keep silence before him.”

3 [✞] A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to Shigionoth.

> **2** [✞] O L**ORD**, [†](#Hbtext_EFN79) I have heard the report of you,

  > and [†](#Hbtext_EFN80) your work, O L**ORD**, do I fear.

> In the midst of the years [†](#Hbtext_EFN81) revive it;

  > in the midst of the years make it known;

  > [†](#Hbtext_EFN82) in wrath remember mercy.

> **3** [✞] God came from [†](#Hbtext_EFN83) Teman,

  > [†](#Hbtext_EFN84) and the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah

> His splendor covered the heavens,

  > and the earth was full of his praise.

> **4**  [†](#Hbtext_EFN85) His brightness was like the light;

  > rays flashed from his hand;

  > and there he veiled his power.

> **5** [✞] [†](#Hbtext_EFN86) Before him went pestilence,

  > and plague followed [†](#Hbtext_EFN87) at his heels. [*](#Hb_NC6)

> **6**  He stood [†](#Hbtext_EFN88) and measured the earth;

  > he looked and shook the nations;

> then the [†](#Hbtext_EFN89) eternal mountains [†](#Hbtext_EFN90) were scattered;

  > the everlasting hills sank low.

  > His were [†](#Hbtext_EFN91) the everlasting ways.

> **7** [✞] I saw the tents of [†](#Hbtext_EFN92) Cushan in affliction;

  > [†](#Hbtext_EFN93) the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.

> **8** [✞] [†](#Hbtext_EFN94) Was your wrath against the rivers, O L**ORD**?

  > Was your anger against the rivers,

  > [†](#Hbtext_EFN94) or your indignation against the sea,

> [†](#Hbtext_EFN95) when you rode on your horses,

  > [†](#Hbtext_EFN95) on your chariot of salvation?

> **9**  You stripped the sheath from your bow,

  > calling for many arrows. [*](#Hb_NC7) Selah

  > [†](#Hbtext_EFN96) You split the earth with rivers.

> **10**  [†](#Hbtext_EFN97) The mountains saw you and writhed;

  > the raging waters swept on;

> [†](#Hbtext_EFN98) the deep gave forth its voice;

  > [†](#Hbtext_EFN99) it lifted its hands on high.

> **11** [✞] [†](#Hbtext_EFN100) The sun and moon stood still in their place

  > [†](#Hbtext_EFN101) at the light of your arrows as they sped,

  > at the flash of your glittering spear.

> **12** [✞] [†](#Hbtext_EFN102) You marched through the earth in fury;

  > [†](#Hbtext_EFN103) you threshed the nations in anger.

> **13** [✞] [†](#Hbtext_EFN104) You went out for the salvation of your people,

  > for the salvation of [†](#Hbtext_EFN105) your anointed.

> [†](#Hbtext_EFN106) You crushed the head of the house of the wicked,

  > laying him bare from thigh to neck. [*](#Hb_NC8) Selah

> **14**  You pierced with his own arrows the heads of his warriors,

  > who came like a whirlwind to scatter me,

  > rejoicing as if to devour the poor in secret.

> **15** [✞] [†](#Hbtext_EFN107) You trampled the sea with your horses,

  > the surging of mighty waters.

> **16** [✞] [†](#Hbtext_EFN108) I hear, and [†](#Hbtext_EFN109) my body trembles;

  > my lips quiver at the sound;

> [†](#Hbtext_EFN110) rottenness enters into my bones;

  > my legs tremble beneath me.

> Yet [†](#Hbtext_EFN111) I will quietly wait for the day of trouble

  > to come upon people who invade us.

> **17** [✞] Though the fig tree should not blossom,

  > nor fruit be on the vines,

> the produce of the olive fail

  > and the fields yield no food,

> the flock be cut off from the fold

  > and there be no herd in the stalls,

> **18** [✞] [†](#Hbtext_EFN112) yet I will rejoice in the L**ORD**;

  > [†](#Hbtext_EFN113) I will take joy in the God of my salvation.

> **19** [✞] G**OD**, the Lord, is my strength;

  > [†](#Hbtext_EFN114) he makes my feet like the deer’s;

  > he makes me [†](#Hbtext_EFN115) tread on my [†](#Hbtext_EFN116) high places.

> [†](#Hbtext_EFN117) To the choirmaster: with [†](#Hbtext_EFN118) stringed [*](#Hb_NC9) instruments.
