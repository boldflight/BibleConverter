### The Wickedness of Judah

1 [✞] The [†](#Is_CR1)vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem [†](#Is_CR2)in the days of [†](#Is_CR3)Uzziah, [†](#Is_CR4)Jotham, [†](#Is_CR5)Ahaz, and [†](#Is_CR6)Hezekiah, kings of Judah.

> **2** [✞] [†](#Is_CR7)Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O [†](#Is_CR8)earth;

  > for the L**ORD** has spoken:

> “Children [*](#Is_NC1) [†](#Is_CR9)have I reared and brought up,

  > but they have rebelled against me.

> **3** [✞] The ox [†](#Is_CR10)knows its owner,

  > and the donkey its master’s crib,

> but Israel does [†](#Is_CR10)not know,

  > my people do not understand.”

> **4** [✞] Ah, sinful nation,

  > a people laden with iniquity,

> [†](#Is_CR11)offspring of evildoers,

  > children who deal corruptly!

> They have forsaken the L**ORD**,

  > they have [†](#Is_CR12)despised [†](#Is_CR13)the Holy One of Israel,

  > they are utterly [†](#Is_CR14)estranged.

> **5** [✞] Why will you still be [†](#Is_CR15)struck down?

  > Why will you [†](#Is_CR16)continue to rebel?

> The whole head is sick,

  > and the whole heart faint.

> **6** [✞] [†](#Is_CR17)From the sole of the foot even to the head,

  > there is no soundness in it,

> but bruises and sores

  > and raw wounds;

> they are [†](#Is_CR18)not pressed out or bound up

  > or softened with oil.

> **7**  [†](#Is_CR19)Your country lies desolate;

  > your cities are burned with fire;

> in your very presence

  > foreigners devour your land;

  > it is desolate, as overthrown by foreigners.

> **8** [✞] And [†](#Is_CR20)the daughter of Zion is left

  > like a [†](#Is_CR21)booth in a vineyard,

> like a lodge in a cucumber field,

  > like a besieged city.

> **9** [✞] [†](#Is_CR22)If the L**ORD** of hosts

  > had not left us [†](#Is_CR23)a few survivors,

> we should have been like [†](#Is_CR24)Sodom,

  > and become like [†](#Is_CR24)Gomorrah.

> **10**  Hear the word of the L**ORD**,

  > you rulers of [†](#Is_CR25), [†](#Is_CR26)Sodom!

> Give ear to the teaching [*](#Is_NC2) of our God,

  > you people of [†](#Is_CR26)Gomorrah!

> **11** [✞] [†](#Is_CR27)“What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices?

  > says the L**ORD**;

> I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams

  > and the fat of well-fed beasts;

> I do not delight in the blood of bulls,

  > or of lambs, or of goats.

> **12** [✞] “When you come to [†](#Is_CR28)appear before me,

  > who has required of you

  > this trampling of my courts?

> **13**  Bring no more vain offerings;

  > incense is an abomination to me.

> [†](#Is_CR29)New moon and Sabbath and the [†](#Is_CR30)calling of convocations—

  > I cannot endure [†](#Is_CR31)iniquity and [†](#Is_CR32)solemn assembly.

> **14**  Your [†](#Is_CR33)new moons and your appointed feasts

  > my soul hates;

> they have become a burden to me;

  > I am weary of bearing them.

> **15** [✞] When you [†](#Is_CR34)spread out your hands,

  > I will hide my eyes from you;

> [†](#Is_CR35)even though you make many prayers,

  > I will not listen;

  > [†](#Is_CR36)your hands are full of blood.

> **16**  [†](#Is_CR37)Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean;

  > remove the evil of your deeds from before my eyes;

> [†](#Is_CR38)cease to do evil,

  > **17** [✞] learn to do good;

> [†](#Is_CR39)seek justice,

  > correct oppression;

> [†](#Is_CR40)bring justice to the fatherless,

  > plead the widow’s cause.

> **18** [✞] “Come now, [†](#Is_CR41)let us reason [*](#Is_NC3) together, says the L**ORD**:

> though your sins are like scarlet,

  > they shall be as [†](#Is_CR42)white as snow;

> though they are red like crimson,

  > they shall become like wool.

> **19** [✞] [†](#Is_CR43)If you are willing and obedient,

  > you shall eat the good of the land;

> **20** [✞] but if you refuse and rebel,

  > you shall be eaten by the sword;

  > [†](#Is_CR44)for the mouth of the L**ORD** has spoken.”

> **21** [✞] How the faithful city

  > [†](#Is_CR45)has become a whore, [*](#Is_NC4)

  > [†](#Is_CR46)she who was full of justice!

> Righteousness lodged in her,

  > but now murderers.

> **22** [✞] [†](#Is_CR47)Your silver has become dross,

  > your best wine mixed with water.

> **23** [✞] Your princes are rebels

  > and companions of thieves.

> Everyone [†](#Is_CR48)loves a bribe

  > and runs after gifts.

> [†](#Is_CR49)They do not bring justice to the fatherless,

  > and the widow’s cause does not come to them.

> **24** [✞] Therefore the [†](#Is_CR50)Lord declares,

  > the L**ORD** of hosts,

  > the [†](#Is_CR51)Mighty One of Israel:

> “Ah, I will get relief from my enemies

  > [†](#Is_CR52)and avenge myself on my foes.

> **25**  [†](#Is_CR53)I will turn my hand against you

  > and will smelt away your [†](#Is_CR54)dross as with lye

  > and remove all your alloy.

> **26** [✞] And I will restore your judges [†](#Is_CR55)as at the first,

  > and your counselors as at the beginning.

> Afterward [†](#Is_CR56)you shall be called the city of righteousness,

  > the faithful city.”

> **27** [✞] [†](#Is_CR57)Zion shall be redeemed by justice,

  > and those in her who repent, by righteousness.

> **28**  [†](#Is_CR58)But rebels and sinners shall be broken together,

  > and those who forsake the L**ORD** shall be consumed.

> **29** [✞] [†](#Is_CR59)For they [*](#Is_NC5) shall be ashamed of [†](#Is_CR60)the oaks

  > that you desired;

> and you shall blush for [†](#Is_CR61)the gardens

  > that you have chosen.

> **30** [✞] For you shall be [†](#Is_CR62)like an oak

  > whose leaf withers,

  > and like a garden without water.

> **31** [✞] And the strong shall become [†](#Is_CR63)tinder,

  > and his work a spark,

> and both of them shall burn together,

  > with [†](#Is_CR64)none to quench them.

2 The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.

> **2** [✞] [†](#Is_CR65)It shall come to pass in the latter days

  > that [†](#Is_CR66)the mountain of the house of the L**ORD**

> shall be established as the highest of the mountains,

  > and shall be lifted up above the hills;

> and [†](#Is_CR67)all the nations shall flow to it,

  > **3** [✞] and [†](#Is_CR68)many peoples shall come, and say:

> “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the L**ORD**,

  > to the house of the God of Jacob,

> that he may teach us his ways

  > and that we may walk in his paths.”

> For [†](#Is_CR69)out of Zion shall go forth the law, [*](#Is_NC6)

  > and the word of the L**ORD** from Jerusalem.

> **4** [✞] He shall judge between the nations,

  > and shall decide disputes for many peoples;

> [†](#Is_CR70)and they shall beat their swords into plowshares,

  > and their spears into pruning hooks;

> [†](#Is_CR71)nation shall not lift up sword against nation,

  > neither shall they learn war anymore.

> **5** [✞] O house of Jacob,

  > come, let us walk

  > in [†](#Is_CR72)the light of the L**ORD**.

> **6** [✞] For you have rejected your people,

  > the house of Jacob,

> because they are full of things [†](#Is_CR73)from the east

  > and [†](#Is_CR74)of fortune-tellers [†](#Is_CR75)like the Philistines,

  > and they [†](#Is_CR76)strike hands with the children of foreigners.

> **7** [✞] Their land is [†](#Is_CR77)filled with silver and gold,

  > and there is no end to their treasures;

> their land is [†](#Is_CR78)filled with horses,

  > and there is no end to their chariots.

> **8** [✞] Their land is [†](#Is_CR79)filled with idols;

  > they bow down to [†](#Is_CR80)the work of their hands,

  > to what their own fingers have made.

> **9**  So man [†](#Is_CR81)is humbled,

  > and each one [†](#Is_CR81)is brought low—

  > do not forgive them!

> **10** [✞] [†](#Is_CR82)Enter into the rock

  > and hide in the dust

> [†](#Is_CR83)from before the terror of the L**ORD**,

  > and from the splendor of his majesty.

> **11** [✞] [†](#Is_CR84)The haughty looks of man shall be brought low,

  > and the lofty pride of men shall be humbled,

> and the L**ORD** alone will be exalted in that day.

> **12**  [†](#Is_CR85)For the L**ORD** of hosts has a day

  > against all that is proud and lofty,

  > against all that is lifted up—and it shall be brought low;

> **13** [✞] against all the [†](#Is_CR86)cedars of Lebanon,

  > lofty and lifted up;

  > and against all the [†](#Is_CR87)oaks of Bashan;

> **14**  against all [†](#Is_CR88)the lofty mountains,

  > and against all the uplifted hills;

> **15**  against every high tower,

  > and against every fortified wall;

> **16** [✞] against all [†](#Is_CR89)the ships of Tarshish,

  > and against all the beautiful craft.

> **17** [✞] [†](#Is_CR90)And the haughtiness of man shall be humbled,

  > and the lofty pride of men shall be brought low,

  > and the L**ORD** alone will be exalted in that day.

> **18**  [†](#Is_CR91)And the idols shall utterly pass away.

> **19**  [†](#Is_CR92)And people shall enter the caves of the rocks

  > and the holes of the ground, [*](#Is_NC7)

> from before the terror of the L**ORD**,

  > and from the splendor of his majesty,

  > [†](#Is_CR93)when he rises to terrify the earth.

> **20** [✞] In that day [†](#Is_CR94)mankind will cast away

  > their idols of silver and their idols of gold,

> which they made for themselves to worship,

  > to the moles and to the [†](#Is_CR95)bats,

> **21**  [†](#Is_CR96)to enter the caverns of the rocks

  > and the clefts of the cliffs,

> from before the terror of the L**ORD**,

  > and from the splendor of his majesty,

  > [†](#Is_CR97)when he rises to terrify the earth.

> **22** [✞] [†](#Is_CR98)Stop regarding man

  > [†](#Is_CR99)in whose nostrils is breath,

  > for of what account is he?

  > is taking away from Jerusalem and from Judah

> support and supply, [*](#Is_NC8)

  > all [†](#Is_CR101)support of bread,

  > and all support of water;

> **2** [✞] [†](#Is_CR102)the mighty man and the soldier,

  > the judge and the prophet,

  > the diviner and the elder,

> **3** [✞] the captain of fifty

  > and the man of rank,

> the counselor and the skillful magician

  > and the expert in charms.

> **4** [✞] [†](#Is_CR103)And I will make boys their princes,

  > and infants [*](#Is_NC9) shall rule over them.

> **5** [✞] [†](#Is_CR104)And the people will oppress one another,

  > every one his fellow

  > and every one his neighbor;

> the youth will be insolent to the elder,

  > and the despised to the honorable.

> **6** [✞] For [†](#Is_CR105)a man will take hold of his brother

  > in the house of his father, saying:

> “You have a cloak;

  > you shall be our leader,

> and this heap of ruins

  > shall be under your rule”;

> **7**  in that day he will speak out, saying:

> “I will not be a [†](#Is_CR106)healer; [*](#Is_NC10)

  > in my house there is neither bread nor cloak;

> you shall not make me

  > leader of the people.”

> **8** [✞] For Jerusalem has stumbled,

  > and Judah has fallen,

> because their [†](#Is_CR107)speech and their deeds are against the L**ORD**,

  > [†](#Is_CR108)defying his glorious presence. [*](#Is_NC11)

> **9** [✞] For the look on their faces bears witness against them;

  > they proclaim their sin [†](#Is_CR109)like Sodom;

  > they do not hide it.

> Woe to them!

  > [†](#Is_CR110)For they have brought evil on themselves.

> **10** [✞] [†](#Is_CR111)Tell the righteous that it shall be well with them,

  > [†](#Is_CR112)for they shall eat the fruit of their deeds.

> **11** [✞] [†](#Is_CR113)Woe to the wicked! It shall be ill with him,

  > for what his hands have dealt out shall be done to him.

> **12** [✞] My people—[†](#Is_CR114)infants are their oppressors,

  > and women rule over them.

> O my people, [†](#Is_CR115)your guides mislead you

  > and they have swallowed up [*](#Is_NC12) the course of your paths.

> **13**  The L**ORD** [†](#Is_CR116)has taken his place to contend;

  > he stands to judge peoples.

> **14** [✞] The L**ORD** will enter into judgment

  > with the [†](#Is_CR117)elders and princes of his people:

> “It is you who [†](#Is_CR118)have devoured [*](#Is_NC13) the vineyard,

  > [†](#Is_CR119)the spoil of the poor is in your houses.

> **15** [✞] What do you mean by [†](#Is_CR120)crushing my people,

  > by grinding the face of the poor?”

> **16** [✞] The L**ORD** said:

> [†](#Is_CR121)Because [†](#Is_CR122)the daughters of Zion are haughty

  > and walk with outstretched necks,

  > glancing wantonly with their eyes,

> mincing along as they go,

  > [†](#Is_CR123)tinkling with their feet,

> **17**  therefore the Lord [†](#Is_CR124)will strike with a scab

  > the heads of [†](#Is_CR125)the daughters of Zion,

  > and the L**ORD** will lay bare their secret parts.

**18**  In that day the Lord will take away [†](#Is_CR126)the finery of the anklets, the [†](#Is_CR127)headbands, and the [†](#Is_CR128)crescents;

**19**  the pendants, the bracelets, and the scarves;

**20**  the [†](#Is_CR129)headdresses, the armlets, the sashes, the perfume boxes, and the amulets;

**21**  the signet rings and [†](#Is_CR130)nose rings;

**22**  the [†](#Is_CR131)festal robes, the mantles, the cloaks, and the handbags;

**23**  the mirrors, the linen garments, the turbans, and the veils.

> **24** [✞] Instead of [†](#Is_CR132)perfume there will be rottenness;

  > and instead of a [†](#Is_CR133)belt, a rope;

> and instead of [†](#Is_CR134)well-set hair, [†](#Is_CR135)baldness;

  > and instead of a rich robe, a [†](#Is_CR136)skirt of sackcloth;

  > and [†](#Is_CR137)branding instead of beauty.

> **25**  Your men shall fall by the sword

  > and your mighty men in battle.

> **26** [✞] And [†](#Is_CR138)her gates shall lament and mourn;

  > empty, she shall [†](#Is_CR139)sit on the ground.

4 [✞] [†](#Is_CR140)And seven women [†](#Is_CR141)shall take hold of [†](#Is_CR140)one man in that day, saying, “We will eat our own bread and wear our own clothes, only let us be called by your name; [†](#Is_CR142)take away our reproach.”

**2** [✞] In that day [†](#Is_CR143)the branch of the L**ORD** shall be beautiful and glorious, and [†](#Is_CR144)the fruit of the land shall be the pride and honor of the survivors of Israel.

**3** [✞] [†](#Is_CR145)And he who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called [†](#Is_CR146)holy, everyone who has [†](#Is_CR147)been recorded for life in Jerusalem,

**4** [✞] when [†](#Is_CR148)the Lord shall have washed away the filth of [†](#Is_CR149)the daughters of Zion and cleansed the bloodstains of Jerusalem from its midst by a spirit of judgment and by [†](#Is_CR150)a spirit of burning. [*](#Is_NC14)

**5** [✞] Then the L**ORD** will create over the whole site of Mount Zion and over her assemblies [†](#Is_CR151)a cloud by day, and smoke and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory there will be [†](#Is_CR152)a canopy.

**6** [✞] [†](#Is_CR153)There will be a [†](#Is_CR154)booth for shade by day from the heat, and [†](#Is_CR155)for a refuge and a shelter from the storm and rain.

  > my love song concerning his vineyard:

> My beloved had [†](#Is_CR156)a vineyard

  > on a very fertile hill.

> **2** [✞] He dug it and cleared it of stones,

  > and planted it with [†](#Is_CR157)choice vines;

> he built a watchtower in the midst of it,

  > and hewed out a wine vat in it;

> and [†](#Is_CR158)he looked for it to yield grapes,

  > but it yielded wild grapes.

> **3**  And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem

  > and men of Judah,

> judge between me and my vineyard.

> **4**  [†](#Is_CR159)What more was there to do for my vineyard,

  > that I have not done in it?

> [†](#Is_CR160)When I looked for it to yield grapes,

  > why did it yield wild grapes?

> **5** [✞] And now I will tell you

  > what I will do to my vineyard.

> I will remove [†](#Is_CR161)its hedge,

  > and it shall be devoured; [*](#Is_NC15)

> [†](#Is_CR162)I will break down its wall,

  > and it shall be trampled down.

> **6** [✞] I will make it a waste;

  > it shall not be pruned or hoed,

  > and [†](#Is_CR163)briers and thorns shall grow up;

> [†](#Is_CR164)I will also command the clouds

  > that they rain no rain upon it.

> **7** [✞] [†](#Is_CR165)For the vineyard of the L**ORD** of hosts

  > is the house of Israel,

> and the men of Judah

  > are his pleasant planting;

> and he looked for justice,

  > but behold, bloodshed; [*](#Is_NC16)

> for righteousness,

  > but behold, an outcry! [*](#Is_NC17)

> **8** [✞] Woe to those who [†](#Is_CR166)join house to house,

  > who add field to field,

> until there is no more room,

  > and you are made to dwell alone

  > in the midst of the land.

> **9** [✞] The L**ORD** of hosts has sworn in my hearing:

> [†](#Is_CR167)“Surely many houses shall be desolate,

  > large and beautiful houses, without inhabitant.

> **10** [✞] [†](#Is_CR168)For ten acres [*](#Is_NC18) of vineyard shall yield but one bath,

  > and a [†](#Is_CR169)homer of seed shall yield but an ephah.” [*](#Is_NC19)

> **11** [✞] Woe to those who [†](#Is_CR170)rise early in the morning,

  > that they may run after strong drink,

> who tarry late into the evening

  > as wine inflames them!

> **12**  [†](#Is_CR171)They have lyre and harp,

  > tambourine and flute and wine at their feasts,

> [†](#Is_CR172)but they do not regard the deeds of the L**ORD**,

  > or see the work of his hands.

> **13** [✞] Therefore my people go into exile

  > [†](#Is_CR173)for lack of knowledge; [*](#Is_NC20)

> their [†](#Is_CR174)honored men go hungry, [*](#Is_NC21)

  > and their multitude is parched with thirst.

> **14** [✞] Therefore Sheol has [†](#Is_CR175)enlarged its appetite

  > and opened [†](#Is_CR176)its mouth beyond measure,

> and the nobility of Jerusalem [*](#Is_NC22) and her multitude will go down,

  > her revelers and he who [†](#Is_CR177)exults in her.

> **15**  [†](#Is_CR178)Man is humbled, and each one is brought low,

  > and the eyes of the haughty [*](#Is_NC23) are brought low.

> **16** [✞] [†](#Is_CR179)But the L**ORD** of hosts is exalted [*](#Is_NC24) in justice,

  > and the Holy God shows himself holy in righteousness.

> **17**  Then shall the lambs graze [†](#Is_CR180)as in their pasture,

  > and [†](#Is_CR181)nomads shall eat among the ruins of the rich.

> **18** [✞] Woe to those who draw iniquity with [†](#Is_CR182)cords of falsehood,

  > who draw sin as with cart ropes,

> **19** [✞] who say: [†](#Is_CR183)“Let him be quick,

  > let him speed his work

  > that we may see it;

> let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near,

  > and let it come, that we may know it!”

> **20** [✞] Woe to [†](#Is_CR184)those who call evil good

  > and good evil,

> [†](#Is_CR185)who put darkness for light

  > and light for darkness,

> who put bitter for sweet

  > and sweet for bitter!

> **21** [✞] Woe to those who are [†](#Is_CR186)wise in their own eyes,

  > and shrewd in their own sight!

> **22** [✞] Woe to those who are [†](#Is_CR187)heroes at drinking wine,

  > and valiant men in mixing strong drink,

> **23** [✞] who [†](#Is_CR188)acquit the guilty for a bribe,

  > and deprive the innocent of his right!

> **24** [✞] Therefore, [†](#Is_CR189)as the tongue of fire devours the stubble,

  > and as dry grass sinks down in the flame,

> so [†](#Is_CR190)their root will be [†](#Is_CR191)as rottenness,

  > and their blossom go up like dust;

> for they have [†](#Is_CR192)rejected the law of the L**ORD** of hosts,

  > and have [†](#Is_CR193)despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.

> **25** [✞] Therefore [†](#Is_CR194)the anger of the L**ORD** was kindled against his people,

  > and he stretched out his hand against them and struck them,

  > and [†](#Is_CR195)the mountains quaked;

> and their corpses were [†](#Is_CR196)as refuse

  > in the midst of the streets.

> [†](#Is_CR197)For all this his anger has not turned away,

  > and his hand is stretched out still.

> **26** [✞] He will [†](#Is_CR198)raise a signal for nations far away,

  > and [†](#Is_CR199)whistle for them [†](#Is_CR200)from the ends of the earth;

> and behold, quickly, speedily they come!

> **27**  [†](#Is_CR201)None is weary, none stumbles,

  > none slumbers or sleeps,

> not a waistband is loose,

  > not a sandal strap broken;

> **28**  [†](#Is_CR202)their arrows are sharp,

  > all their bows bent,

> their horses’ hoofs seem like flint,

  > and their wheels [†](#Is_CR203)like the whirlwind.

> **29**  Their roaring is like a lion,

  > like young lions they roar;

> they growl and [†](#Is_CR204)seize their prey;

  > they carry it off, and none can rescue.

> **30** [✞] They will growl over it on that day,

  > like the growling of the sea.

> And if one looks to the land,

  > behold, [†](#Is_CR205)darkness and distress;

> and the light is darkened by its clouds.

6 [✞] In the year that [†](#Is_CR206)King Uzziah died I [†](#Is_CR207)saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train [*](#Is_NC25) of his robe filled the temple.

**2** [✞] Above him stood the seraphim. Each had [†](#Is_CR208)six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.

**3** [✞] And one called to another and said:

> [†](#Is_CR209)“Holy, holy, holy is the L**ORD** of hosts;

**6** [✞] Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar.

**7** [✞] And he [†](#Is_CR216)touched my mouth and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.”

**8** [✞] And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for [†](#Is_CR217)us?” Then I said, “Here I am! Send me.”

**9** [✞] And he said, “Go, and say to this people:

> [†](#Is_CR218)“‘Keep on hearing, [*](#Is_NC27) but do not understand;

> keep on seeing, [*](#Is_NC28) but do not perceive.’

> **10**  [†](#Is_CR219)Make the heart of this people [†](#Is_CR220)dull, [*](#Is_NC29)

  > and their ears heavy,

  > and blind their eyes;

> [†](#Is_CR221)lest they see with their eyes,

  > and hear with their ears,

  > and turn and be healed.”

> **11** [✞] Then I said, [†](#Is_CR222)“How long, O Lord?”

> And he said:

> “Until [†](#Is_CR223)cities lie waste

  > without inhabitant,

> and houses without people,

  > and the land is a desolate waste,

> **12**  and the L**ORD** removes people far away,

  > and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.

7 [✞] In the days of [†](#Is_CR227)Ahaz the son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, [†](#Is_CR228)Rezin the king of Syria and [†](#Is_CR228)Pekah the son of Remaliah the king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to wage war against it, but could not yet mount an attack against it.

**2** [✞] When the house of David was told, [†](#Is_CR229)“Syria is in league with [*](#Is_NC32) [†](#Is_CR230)Ephraim,” the heart of Ahaz [*](#Is_NC33) and the heart of his people shook as the trees of the forest shake before the wind.

**3** [✞] And the L**ORD** said to Isaiah, “Go out to meet Ahaz, you and [†](#Is_CR231)Shear-jashub [*](#Is_NC34) your son, at the end of [†](#Is_CR232)the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Washer’s Field.

**4** [✞] And say to him, [†](#Is_CR233)‘Be careful, [†](#Is_CR234)be quiet, do not fear, and do not let your heart be faint because of these two [†](#Is_CR235)smoldering stumps of firebrands, at the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria and [†](#Is_CR236)the son of Remaliah.

**5**  Because Syria, with Ephraim and [†](#Is_CR237)the son of Remaliah, has devised evil against you, saying,

**6**  “Let us go up against Judah and terrify it, and let us conquer it [*](#Is_NC35) for ourselves, and set up the son of Tabeel as king in the midst of it,”

**7** [✞] thus says the Lord G**OD**:

> [†](#Is_CR238)“‘It shall not stand,

  > and it shall not come to pass.

> **8** [✞] For the head of Syria is [†](#Is_CR239)Damascus,

  > and the head of Damascus is Rezin.

> And within sixty-five years

  > Ephraim will be shattered from being a people.

> **9** [✞] And the head of Ephraim is Samaria,

  > and the head of Samaria is [†](#Is_CR240)the son of Remaliah.

> [†](#Is_CR241)If you [*](#Is_NC36) are not firm in faith,

  > you will not be firm at all.’”

**10**  Again the L**ORD** spoke to Ahaz:

**11** [✞] “Ask [†](#Is_CR242)a sign of the L**ORD** your [*](#Is_NC37) God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven.”

**12**  But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, and I will not put the L**ORD** to the test.”

**13** [✞] And he [*](#Is_NC38) said, “Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary men, that you [†](#Is_CR243)weary my God also?

**14** [✞] Therefore the [†](#Is_CR244)Lord himself will give you a sign. [†](#Is_CR245)Behold, the [†](#Is_CR246)virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name [†](#Is_CR247)Immanuel. [*](#Is_NC39)

**15** [✞] He shall eat [†](#Is_CR248)curds and honey when he knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good.

**16** [✞] [†](#Is_CR249)For before the boy knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land whose two kings you dread will be [†](#Is_CR250)deserted.

**17** [✞] [†](#Is_CR251)The L**ORD** will bring upon you and upon your people and upon your father’s house such days as have not come since the day that [†](#Is_CR252)Ephraim departed from Judah—the king of Assyria!”

**18** [✞] In that day the L**ORD** will [†](#Is_CR253)whistle for the fly that is at the end of the streams of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.

**19** [✞] And they will all come and settle in the steep ravines, and [†](#Is_CR254)in the clefts of the rocks, and on all the thornbushes, and on all the pastures. [*](#Is_NC40)

**20** [✞] In that day [†](#Is_CR255)the Lord will [†](#Is_CR256)shave with a razor that is [†](#Is_CR257)hired beyond [†](#Is_CR258)the River[*](#Is_NC41)—with the king of Assyria—the head and the hair of the feet, and it will sweep away the beard also.

**21**  [†](#Is_CR259)In that day a man will keep alive a young cow and two sheep,

**22** [✞] and because of the abundance of milk that they give, he will eat curds, for everyone who is left in the land will eat [†](#Is_CR260)curds and honey.

**23** [✞] In that day every place where there used to be a thousand vines, worth a thousand shekels[*](#Is_NC42) of silver, will become [†](#Is_CR261)briers and thorns.

**24**  [†](#Is_CR262)With bow and arrows a man will come there, for all the land will be briers and thorns.

**25**  [†](#Is_CR263)And as for all the hills that used to be hoed with a hoe, you will not come there for fear [†](#Is_CR264)of briers and thorns, but they will become a place where cattle are let loose and where sheep tread.8 [✞] Then the L**ORD** said to me, “Take a large tablet [†](#Is_CR265)and write on it in common characters, [*](#Is_NC43) ‘Belonging to Maher-shalal-hash-baz.’ [*](#Is_NC44)

**2** [✞] And [†](#Is_CR266)I will get reliable witnesses, [†](#Is_CR267)Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah, to attest for me.”

**3** [✞] And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then the L**ORD** said to me, [†](#Is_CR268)“Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz;

**4**  [†](#Is_CR269)for before the boy knows how to cry ‘My father’ or ‘My mother,’ the [†](#Is_CR269)wealth of [†](#Is_CR270)Damascus and the spoil of [†](#Is_CR270)Samaria will be carried away before the king of Assyria.”

**5**  The L**ORD** spoke to me again:

**6** [✞] “Because this people has refused the waters of [†](#Is_CR271)Shiloah that flow gently, and rejoice over [†](#Is_CR272)Rezin and the son of Remaliah,

**7** [✞] therefore, behold, the Lord is bringing up against them [†](#Is_CR273)the waters of [†](#Is_CR274)the River,[*](#Is_NC45) mighty and many, the king of Assyria and all his glory. And it [†](#Is_CR275)will rise over all its channels and go over all its banks,

**8** [✞] and it will sweep on into Judah, it will overflow and pass on, [†](#Is_CR276)reaching even to the neck, and its [†](#Is_CR277)outspread wings will fill the breadth of your land, [†](#Is_CR278)O Immanuel.”

> **9** [✞] Be broken, [*](#Is_NC46) you peoples, and [†](#Is_CR279)be shattered; [*](#Is_NC47)

  > give ear, all you far countries;

> strap on your armor and be shattered;

  > strap on your armor and be shattered.

> **10** [✞] Take counsel together, but it will come to nothing;

  > speak a word, [†](#Is_CR280)but it will not stand,

  > for God [†](#Is_CR281)is with us. [*](#Is_NC48)

**11** [✞] For the L**ORD** spoke thus to me with his strong hand upon me, and [†](#Is_CR282)warned me not to walk in the way of this people, saying:

**12** [✞] “Do not call [†](#Is_CR283)conspiracy all that this people calls conspiracy, and [†](#Is_CR284)do not fear what they fear, nor be in dread.

**13** [✞] But the L**ORD** of hosts, [†](#Is_CR285)him you shall honor as holy. Let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.

**14** [✞] And he will become a [†](#Is_CR286)sanctuary and [†](#Is_CR287)a stone of offense and a rock of stumbling to both houses of Israel, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

**15**  And many [†](#Is_CR288)shall stumble on it. They shall fall and be broken; they shall be snared and taken.”

**16** [✞] Bind up [†](#Is_CR289)the testimony; [†](#Is_CR290)seal the teaching [*](#Is_NC49) among my disciples.

**17** [✞] I will [†](#Is_CR291)wait for the L**ORD**, who is [†](#Is_CR292)hiding his face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope in him.

**18** [✞] [†](#Is_CR293)Behold, I and [†](#Is_CR294)the children whom the L**ORD** has given me are signs and portents in Israel from the L**ORD** of hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion.

**19** [✞] And when they say to you, “Inquire of the [†](#Is_CR295)mediums and the necromancers who chirp and mutter,” should not a people inquire of their God? Should they inquire of [†](#Is_CR296)the dead on behalf of the living?

**20** [✞] [†](#Is_CR297)To the teaching and to the testimony! If they will not speak according to this word, it is because they have no [†](#Is_CR298)dawn.

**21**  They will pass through the land, [*](#Is_NC50) greatly distressed and hungry. And when they are hungry, they will be enraged and will speak contemptuously against [*](#Is_NC51) their king and their God, and turn their faces upward.

**22** [✞] [†](#Is_CR299)And they will look to the earth, but behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish. And they will be thrust into [†](#Is_CR300)thick darkness.9 [✞] [*](#Is_NC52) But there will be no [†](#Is_CR301)gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time he [†](#Is_CR302)brought into contempt the land of [†](#Is_CR303)Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the latter time he [†](#Is_CR304)has made glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations. [*](#Is_NC53)

> **2** [✞] [*](#Is_NC54) [†](#Is_CR305)The people [†](#Is_CR306)who walked in darkness

  > have seen a great light;

> those who dwelt in a land of [†](#Is_CR307)deep darkness,

  > on them has light shone.

> **3** [✞] [†](#Is_CR308)You have multiplied the nation;

  > you have increased its joy;

  > as with [†](#Is_CR309)joy at the harvest,

  > as they [†](#Is_CR310)are glad [†](#Is_CR311)when they divide the spoil.

> **4** [✞] [†](#Is_CR312)For the yoke of his burden,

  > [†](#Is_CR313)and the staff for his shoulder,

  > the rod of his oppressor,

  > you have broken as [†](#Is_CR314)on the day of Midian.

  > and every garment rolled in blood

  > to establish it and to uphold it

  > from this time forth and forevermore.

> [†](#Is_CR327)The zeal of the L**ORD** of hosts will do this.

> **8** [✞] The Lord has sent a word against Jacob,

  > and it will fall on Israel;

> **9** [✞] and all the people will know,

  > [†](#Is_CR328)Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria,

  > who say in pride and in arrogance of heart:

  > but we will build with dressed stones;

  > but we will put cedars in their place.”

> **11** [✞] But the L**ORD** raises the adversaries of Rezin against him,

> **12** [✞] [†](#Is_CR329)The Syrians on the east and [†](#Is_CR330)the Philistines on the west

  > devour Israel with open mouth.

> [†](#Is_CR331)For all this his anger has not turned away,

> **13** [✞] The people [†](#Is_CR332)did not turn to him who struck them,

  > nor inquire of the L**ORD** of hosts.

> **14** [✞] So the L**ORD** cut off from Israel [†](#Is_CR333)head and tail,

  > palm branch and reed in one day—

> **15**  [†](#Is_CR334)the elder and honored man is the head,

  > and [†](#Is_CR335)the prophet who teaches lies is the tail;

> **16**  for those who guide this people have been leading them astray,

  > and those who are guided by them are swallowed up.

> **17** [✞] Therefore the Lord does not [†](#Is_CR336)rejoice over their young men,

  > and has no compassion on their fatherless and widows;

> for everyone is [†](#Is_CR337)godless and an evildoer,

  > and every mouth speaks [†](#Is_CR338)folly. [*](#Is_NC57)

> [†](#Is_CR339)For all this his anger has not turned away,

  > and his hand is stretched out still.

> **18**  For wickedness burns like [†](#Is_CR340)a fire;

  > it consumes briers and thorns;

> **19**  Through the wrath of the L**ORD** of hosts

  > the land is scorched,

  > [†](#Is_CR342)no one spares another.

> **20** [✞] [†](#Is_CR343)They slice meat on the right, but are still hungry,

  > and they devour on the left, but are not satisfied;

> [†](#Is_CR344)each devours the flesh of his own arm,

> **21** [✞] Manasseh devours Ephraim, and Ephraim devours Manasseh;

  > together they are [†](#Is_CR345)against Judah.

> [†](#Is_CR346)For all this his anger has not turned away,

  > and his hand is stretched out still.

  > and the writers who [†](#Is_CR348)keep writing oppression,

> **2** [✞] to turn aside the needy from justice

  > and [†](#Is_CR349)to rob the poor of my people of their right,

> that widows may be their spoil,

  > and that they may make the fatherless their prey!

> **3** [✞] What will you do on [†](#Is_CR350)the day of punishment,

  > in the ruin that will come [†](#Is_CR351)from afar?

> To whom will you flee for help,

> **4**  Nothing remains but to crouch among the prisoners

> [†](#Is_CR352)For all this his anger has not turned away,

  > and his hand is stretched out still.

> **5** [✞] Woe to Assyria, [†](#Is_CR353)the rod of my anger;

  > the staff in their hands is my fury!

> **6** [✞] Against a [†](#Is_CR354)godless nation I send him,

  > and against the people of my wrath I command him,

> to take [†](#Is_CR355)spoil and seize plunder,

  > and to [†](#Is_CR356)tread them down like the mire of the streets.

> **7** [✞] But he [†](#Is_CR357)does not so intend,

  > and his heart does not so think;

> but it is in his heart to destroy,

  > and to cut off nations not a few;

> **8**  for he says:

> [†](#Is_CR358)“Are not my commanders all kings?

> **9** [✞] [†](#Is_CR359)Is not [†](#Is_CR360)Calno like [†](#Is_CR361)Carchemish?

  > Is not [†](#Is_CR362)Hamath like [†](#Is_CR363)Arpad?

  > [†](#Is_CR364)Is not [†](#Is_CR365)Samaria like Damascus?

> **10** [✞] As my hand has reached to [†](#Is_CR366)the kingdoms of the idols,

  > whose carved images were greater than those of Jerusalem and Samaria,

> **11**  shall I not do to Jerusalem and [†](#Is_CR367)her idols

  > [†](#Is_CR368)as I have done to Samaria and her images?”

**12** [✞] [†](#Is_CR369)When the Lord has finished all his work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, [†](#Is_CR370)he[*](#Is_NC58) will punish the speech[*](#Is_NC59) of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria and the boastful look in his eyes.

**13** [✞] [†](#Is_CR371)For he says:

> “By the strength of my hand I have done it,

  > and by my wisdom, for I have understanding;

> I remove the boundaries of peoples,

  > and plunder their treasures;

  > like a bull I bring down those who sit on thrones.

> **14** [✞] My hand has found like a nest

  > the wealth of the peoples;

> and as one gathers eggs that have been forsaken,

  > so I have gathered all the earth;

> and there was none that moved a wing

  > or opened the mouth or chirped.”

> **15** [✞] Shall [†](#Is_CR372)the axe boast over him who hews with it,

  > or the saw magnify itself against him who wields it?

> As if a rod should wield him who lifts it,

  > or as if a staff should lift him who is not wood!

> **16** [✞] Therefore the Lord G**OD** of hosts

  > will send wasting sickness among his [†](#Is_CR373)stout warriors,

> and under his glory [†](#Is_CR374)a burning will be kindled,

  > like the burning of fire.

> **17** [✞] [†](#Is_CR375)The light of Israel will become a fire,

  > and [†](#Is_CR376)his Holy One a flame,

> and [†](#Is_CR377)it will burn and devour

  > his thorns and briers [†](#Is_CR378)in one day.

> **18** [✞] The glory of [†](#Is_CR379)his forest and of his [†](#Is_CR380)fruitful land

  > the L**ORD** will destroy, both soul and body,

  > and it will be as when a sick man wastes away.

> **19**  The remnant of the trees of his forest will be so few

  > that a child can write them down.

**20** [✞] [†](#Is_CR381)In that day [†](#Is_CR382)the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will no more [†](#Is_CR383)lean on him who struck them, but [†](#Is_CR384)will lean on the L**ORD**, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.

**21**  A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, [†](#Is_CR385)to the mighty God.

**22** [✞] [†](#Is_CR386)For though your people Israel be as the sand of the sea, [†](#Is_CR387)only a remnant of them will return. [†](#Is_CR388)Destruction is decreed, overflowing with righteousness.

**23** [✞] For the Lord G**OD** of hosts will make a full end, as decreed, in the midst of all the earth.

**24** [✞] Therefore thus says the Lord G**OD** of hosts: “O my people, [†](#Is_CR389)who dwell in Zion, [†](#Is_CR390)be not afraid of the Assyrians when they strike with the rod and lift up their staff against you as [†](#Is_CR391)the Egyptians did.

**25** [✞] For [†](#Is_CR392)in a very little while my fury will come to an end, and my anger will be directed to their destruction.

**26** [✞] And [†](#Is_CR393)the L**ORD** of hosts will wield against them a whip, as when he struck [†](#Is_CR394)Midian [†](#Is_CR395)at the rock of Oreb. And his staff will be over the sea, and he will lift it [†](#Is_CR396)as he did in Egypt.

**27** [✞] And in that day [†](#Is_CR397)his burden will depart from your shoulder, and [†](#Is_CR398)his yoke from your neck; and the yoke will be broken because of the fat.” [*](#Is_NC60)

> **28** [✞] He has come to Aiath;

> he has passed through [†](#Is_CR399)Migron;

  > at Michmash he stores [†](#Is_CR400)his baggage;

> **29**  they have crossed over [†](#Is_CR401)the pass;

  > at [†](#Is_CR402)Geba they lodge for the night;

> [†](#Is_CR403)Ramah trembles;

  > [†](#Is_CR404)Gibeah of Saul has fled.

> **30**  Cry aloud, O daughter of [†](#Is_CR405)Gallim!

  > Give attention, O Laishah!

  > O poor [†](#Is_CR406)Anathoth!

> **31**  Madmenah is in flight;

  > the inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety.

> **32**  This very day he will halt at [†](#Is_CR407)Nob;

  > he will shake his fist

  > at the mount of [†](#Is_CR408)the daughter of Zion,

  > the hill of Jerusalem.

> **33** [✞] Behold, the Lord **GOD** of hosts

  > [†](#Is_CR409)will lop [†](#Is_CR410)the boughs with terrifying power;

> the great in height will be hewn down,

  > and the lofty will be brought low.

> **34** [✞] He will cut down [†](#Is_CR411)the thickets of the forest with an axe,

  > and [†](#Is_CR412)Lebanon will fall by the Majestic One.
