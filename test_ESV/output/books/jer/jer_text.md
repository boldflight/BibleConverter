## Knowledge of Self and Knowledge of God

T here is a mutual dependence between our knowledge of ourselves and our knowledge of God. As soon as I am aware of myself as a self, I realize that I am not God; I am a creature. I have a birth date, a time when my life began on earth. My tombstone at my death will not engrave eternity as my starting point.

My sense of creatureliness drives my thinking back to my Creator or “up” to my Creator. I cannot contemplate God or anything else outside of myself until I am first aware of myself. Yet I cannot grasp the meaning of myself fully until I understand myself in relationship to God. Ultimately then, anthropology, the study of mankind, is a subdivision of theology, the study of God.

The crisis of modern humanity is found in the rupture between anthropology and theology, between the study of human beings and the study of God. When our story is told in isolation or divorced from the story of God, then it indeed becomes “a tale / Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, / Signifying nothing.” If we are considered without reference to God, we become a “useless passion,” as philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre declared.

What is a “useless passion”? A passion is an intense feeling. Human life is marked by intense feelings. They include such passions as love, hate, fear, guilt, ambition, lust, envy, jealousy, and a host of others. As creatures we have deep feelings about our lives. The question haunts us: Are all these feelings useless? Is all our striving and caring merely an exercise in futility, an excursion of vanity?

The meaning of our lives is at stake. Our dignity is on the line. If human beings are considered alone, apart from relationship to God, then they remain alone and insignificant. If we are not creatures made by and related to God, we are cosmic accidents. Our origin is insignificant and our destiny is equally insignificant. If we emerge from the slime by accident and finally disentegrate into a void or abyss of nothingness, then we live our lives between two poles of absolute meaninglessness. We are peeled zeroes, stripped naked of dignity and worth.

To assign dignity to a human being temporarily, that is, between the poles of a meaningless origin and a meaningless destiny, is to indulge ourselves in pure unvarnished sentiment. We tease ourselves with self-delusion.

Our origin and our destiny are tied to God. The only ultimate meaning we can have must be theological. The question we ask was asked by the psalmist:

“When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, what is man that you are mindful of him, and the son of man that you care for him? Yet you have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor” (Ps. 8:3-5).

To be _created by_ God is to be _related to_ God. This inescapable relationship insures that we are not useless noise or feeling. In creation we receive a crown of glory. A crown of glory is a tiara of dignity. With God we have dignity; without God we are nothing.

### The Call of Jeremiah

1 [✞] The words of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah, one [†](#Jer_CR1) of the priests who were in [†](#Jer_CR2) Anathoth in the land of Benjamin,

**2** [✞] to whom the word of the L**ORD** came in the days of [†](#Jer_CR3) Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in [†](#Jer_CR4) the thirteenth year of his reign.

**3** [✞] It came also in the days of [†](#Jer_CR5) Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, and [†](#Jer_CR6) until the end of the eleventh year of [†](#Jer_CR7) Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, [†](#Jer_CR8) until the captivity of Jerusalem in the fifth month.

**4**  Now the word of the L**ORD** came to me, saying,

> **5** [✞] [†](#Jer_CR9)“Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,

> and before you were born [†](#Jer_CR10) I consecrated you;

> “Do not say, ‘I am only a youth’;

> for to all to whom I send you, you shall go,

> and [†](#Jer_CR14) whatever I command you, you shall speak.

> **8** [✞] [†](#Jer_CR15) Do not be afraid of them,

> [†](#Jer_CR16) for I am with you to deliver you,

> “Behold, I have put [†](#Jer_CR19) my words in your mouth.

> **10** [✞] See, I have set you this day [†](#Jer_CR20) over nations and over kingdoms,

> [†](#Jer_CR21) to pluck up and to break down,

> to destroy and to overthrow,

**11** [✞] And the word of the L**ORD** came to me, saying, [†](#Jer_CR22)“Jeremiah, what do you see?” And I said, “I see an almond [*](#Jer_NC1) branch.”

**12**  Then the L**ORD** said to me, “You have seen well, for I am watching over my word to perform it.”

**13** [✞] The word of the L**ORD** came to me a second time, saying, “What do you see?” And I said, “I see [†](#Jer_CR23) a boiling pot, facing away [†](#Jer_CR24) from the north.”

**14** [✞] Then the L**ORD** said to me, [†](#Jer_CR25) “Out of the north disaster [*](#Jer_NC2) shall be let loose upon all the inhabitants of the land.

**15**  For behold, [†](#Jer_CR26) I am calling all the tribes of the kingdoms of the north, declares the L**ORD**, [†](#Jer_CR27) and they shall come, and every one shall set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, against all its walls all around and against all the cities of Judah.

**16** [✞] And [†](#Jer_CR28) I will declare my judgments against them, for all their evil [†](#Jer_CR29) in forsaking me. [†](#Jer_CR30) They have made offerings to other gods and [†](#Jer_CR31) worshiped the works of their own hands.

**17** [✞] But you, [†](#Jer_CR32) dress yourself for work; [*](#Jer_NC3) arise, and [†](#Jer_CR33) say to them everything that I command you. [†](#Jer_CR34) Do not be dismayed by them, lest I dismay you before them.

**18** [✞] And I, behold, I make you this day [†](#Jer_CR35) a fortified city, [†](#Jer_CR36) an iron pillar, and [†](#Jer_CR37) bronze walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests, and the people of the land.

**19**  [†](#Jer_CR38) They will fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you, for [†](#Jer_CR39) I am with you, declares the L**ORD**, to deliver you.”2 [✞] The word of the L**ORD** came to me, saying,

**2** [✞] “Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem, Thus says the L**ORD**,

> “I remember the devotion of [†](#Jer_CR40) your youth,

  > your love [†](#Jer_CR41) as a bride,

> [†](#Jer_CR42) how you followed me in the wilderness,

  > [†](#Jer_CR43) in a land not sown.

> **3** [✞] [†](#Jer_CR44) Israel was holy to the L**ORD**,

  > [†](#Jer_CR45) the firstfruits of his harvest.

> [†](#Jer_CR46) All who ate of it incurred guilt;

  > disaster came upon them,

**4**  Hear the word of the L**ORD**, O house of Jacob, and all the clans of the house of Israel.

**5**  Thus says the L**ORD**:

> [†](#Jer_CR47) “What wrong did your fathers find in me

  > that they went far from me,

> [†](#Jer_CR48) and went after [†](#Jer_CR49) worthlessness, and became worthless?

> **6**  They did not say, [†](#Jer_CR50)‘Where is the L**ORD**

  > who brought us up from the land of Egypt,

> who led us [†](#Jer_CR51) in the wilderness,

  > in a land of deserts and pits,

> in a land of drought and deep darkness,

  > in a land that none passes through,

  > where no man dwells?’

> **7** [✞] [†](#Jer_CR52) And I brought you into a plentiful land

  > to enjoy its fruits and its good things.

> But when you came in, [†](#Jer_CR53) you defiled my land

  > and made my heritage an abomination.

> **8** [✞] The priests did not say, ‘Where is the L**ORD**?’

  > [†](#Jer_CR54) Those who handle the law did not know me;

> [†](#Jer_CR55) the shepherds [*](#Jer_NC4) transgressed against me;

  > [†](#Jer_CR56) the prophets prophesied by Baal

  > and went after [†](#Jer_CR57) things that do not profit.

> **9** [✞] “Therefore [†](#Jer_CR58) I still contend with you,

  > and [†](#Jer_CR59) with your children’s children I will contend.

> **10** [✞] For cross to the coasts of [†](#Jer_CR60) Cyprus and see,

  > or send to [†](#Jer_CR61) Kedar and examine with care;

  > see if there has been such a thing.

> **11**  [†](#Jer_CR62) Has a nation changed its gods,

  > [†](#Jer_CR63) even though they are no gods?

> But my people [†](#Jer_CR64) have changed their glory

  > for [†](#Jer_CR65) that which does not profit.

> **12** [✞] Be appalled, [†](#Jer_CR66) O heavens, at this;

  > be shocked, be utterly desolate,

> **13** [✞] for my people have committed two evils:

> [†](#Jer_CR67) they have forsaken [†](#Jer_CR68) me,

  > the fountain of [†](#Jer_CR69) living waters,

> and hewed out cisterns for themselves,

  > broken cisterns that can hold no water.

> **14**  [†](#Jer_CR70) “Is Israel a slave? Is he a homeborn servant?

  > Why then has he become a prey?

> **15** [✞] [†](#Jer_CR71) The lions have roared against him;

  > they have roared loudly.

  > to drink the waters of [†](#Jer_CR79) the Nile?

> [†](#Jer_CR80) Or what do you gain by going to Assyria

  > to drink the waters of [†](#Jer_CR81) the Euphrates? [*](#Jer_NC6)

> **19**  [†](#Jer_CR82) Your evil will chastise you,

> Behold, you have spoken,

  > but you have done all the evil that you could.”

**6** [✞] The L**ORD** said to me in the days of [†](#Jer_CR125) King Josiah: “Have you seen what she did, that faithless one, Israel, [†](#Jer_CR126) how she went up on every high hill and under every green tree, and there [†](#Jer_CR127) played the whore?

**7**  And I thought, ‘After she has done all this she will return to me,’ but she did not return, and her treacherous [†](#Jer_CR128) sister Judah saw it.

**8** [✞] She saw that for all the adulteries of that faithless one, Israel, [†](#Jer_CR129) I had sent her away with [†](#Jer_CR130) a decree of divorce. [†](#Jer_CR131) Yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear, but she too went [†](#Jer_CR132) and played the whore.

**9** [✞] Because she took her whoredom lightly, she polluted the land, committing adultery with [†](#Jer_CR133) stone and tree.

**10**  Yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah did not return to me [†](#Jer_CR134) with her whole heart, but in pretense, declares the L**ORD**.”

**11**  And the L**ORD** said to me, [†](#Jer_CR135) “Faithless Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.

**12** [✞] Go, and proclaim these words toward [†](#Jer_CR136) the north, and say,

> [†](#Jer_CR137) “‘Return, faithless Israel,

> I will not look on you in anger,

  > for [†](#Jer_CR138) I am merciful,

> [†](#Jer_CR139) I will not be angry forever.

> **13** [✞] [†](#Jer_CR140) Only acknowledge your guilt,

  > that you rebelled against the L**ORD** your God

> and scattered your favors among foreigners under [†](#Jer_CR141) every green tree,

  > and that you have not obeyed my voice,

  > [†](#Jer_CR143) for I am your master;

> I will take you, one from a city and two from a family,

  > and I will bring you to Zion.

**15** [✞] “‘And [†](#Jer_CR144) I will give you shepherds after my own heart, [†](#Jer_CR145) who will feed you with knowledge and understanding.

**16** [✞] And when you have multiplied and been fruitful in the land, in those days, declares the L**ORD**, they shall no more say, “The ark of the covenant of the L**ORD**.” It shall not come to mind or be remembered or missed; it shall not be made again.

**17** [✞] At that time Jerusalem shall be called the throne of the L**ORD**, [†](#Jer_CR146) and all nations shall gather to it, [†](#Jer_CR147) to the presence of the L**ORD** in Jerusalem, and they shall no more stubbornly follow their own evil heart.

**18**  [†](#Jer_CR148) In those days the house of Judah shall join the house of Israel, and together they shall come from the land [†](#Jer_CR149) of the north to [†](#Jer_CR150) the land that I gave your fathers for a heritage.

**24** [✞] “But from our youth the shameful thing has devoured all for which our fathers labored, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.

**25**  [†](#Jer_CR159) Let us lie down in our shame, and let our dishonor cover us. For [†](#Jer_CR160) we have sinned against the L**ORD** our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and we have not obeyed the voice of the L**ORD** our God.”

  > [†](#Jer_CR161) to me you should return.

**3**  For thus says the L**ORD** to the men of Judah and Jerusalem:

  > and burn with none to quench it,

  > [†](#Jer_CR170) because of the evil of your deeds.”

**5** [✞] Declare in Judah, and proclaim in Jerusalem, and say,

> [†](#Jer_CR171) “Blow the trumpet through the land;

> “Besiegers come [†](#Jer_CR190) from a distant land;

  > Oh the walls of my heart!

> My heart is beating wildly;

> **25** [✞] [†](#Jer_CR201) I looked, and behold, there was no man,

  > and all the birds of the air had fled.

> **26** [✞] I looked, and behold, the [†](#Jer_CR202) fruitful land was a desert,

  > and all its cities were laid in ruins

  > before the L**ORD**, before [†](#Jer_CR203) his fierce anger.

**27**  For thus says the L**ORD**, “The whole land shall be a desolation; [†](#Jer_CR204) yet I will not make a full end.

> **28**  [†](#Jer_CR205) “For this the earth shall mourn,

  > [†](#Jer_CR206) and the heavens above be dark;

> **29**  At the noise of horseman and archer

> In vain you beautify yourself.

  > [†](#Jer_CR211) Your lovers despise you;

> **31** [✞] For I heard [†](#Jer_CR212) a cry as of a woman in labor,

  > anguish as of one giving birth to her first child,

> a nation whose language you do not know,

  > [†](#Jer_CR243) nor can you understand what they say.

> **16**  [†](#Jer_CR244) Their quiver is like [†](#Jer_CR245) an open tomb;

**18**  “But even in those days, declares the L**ORD**, [†](#Jer_CR248) I will not make a full end of you.

**19**  And when your people say, [†](#Jer_CR249)‘Why has the L**ORD** our God done all these things to us?’ you shall say to them, ‘As you have forsaken me and served foreign gods in your land, [†](#Jer_CR250) so you shall serve foreigners in a land that is not yours.’”

7 The word that came to Jeremiah from the L**ORD**:

**2** [✞] [†](#Jer_CR331) “Stand in the gate of the L**ORD**’s house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the L**ORD**, all you men of Judah who enter these gates to worship the L**ORD**.

**3** [✞] Thus says the L**ORD** of hosts, the God of Israel: [†](#Jer_CR332) Amend your ways and your deeds, and I will let you dwell in this place.

**4** [✞] [†](#Jer_CR333) Do not trust in these deceptive words: ‘This is the temple of the L**ORD**, the temple of the L**ORD**, the temple of the L**ORD**.’

**5** [✞] “For if you truly [†](#Jer_CR334) amend your ways and your deeds, if you truly [†](#Jer_CR335) execute justice one with another,

**6** [✞] if you [†](#Jer_CR336) do not oppress the sojourner, the fatherless, or the widow, [†](#Jer_CR337) or shed innocent blood in this place, [†](#Jer_CR338) and if you do not go after other gods to your own harm,

**7**  [†](#Jer_CR339) then I will let you dwell in this place, [†](#Jer_CR340) in the land that I gave of old to your fathers forever.

**8**  “Behold, you trust in deceptive words to no avail.

**9** [✞] [†](#Jer_CR341) Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, [†](#Jer_CR342) swear falsely, [†](#Jer_CR343) make offerings to Baal, [†](#Jer_CR344) and go after other gods that you have not known,

**10** [✞] and then come and stand before me in this house, [†](#Jer_CR345) which is called by my name, and say, ‘We are delivered!’—only to go on doing all these abominations?

**11** [✞] [†](#Jer_CR346) Has this house, [†](#Jer_CR347) which is called by my name, [†](#Jer_CR348) become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I myself have seen it, declares the L**ORD**.

**12** [✞] Go now to [†](#Jer_CR349) my place that was in Shiloh, [†](#Jer_CR350) where I made my name dwell at first, and [†](#Jer_CR351) see what I did to it because of the evil of my people Israel.

**13** [✞] And now, because you have done all these things, declares the L**ORD**, and [†](#Jer_CR352) when I spoke to you persistently you did not listen, and [†](#Jer_CR353) when I called you, you did not answer,

**14**  therefore I will do to [†](#Jer_CR354) the house [†](#Jer_CR355) that is called by my name, and in which you trust, and to the place that I gave to you and to your fathers, [†](#Jer_CR356) as I did to Shiloh.

**15**  [†](#Jer_CR357) And I will cast you out of my sight, [†](#Jer_CR358) as I cast out all your kinsmen, all the offspring of [†](#Jer_CR359) Ephraim.

**16** [✞] “As for you, [†](#Jer_CR360) do not pray for this people, or lift up a cry or prayer for them, and do not intercede with me, for I will not hear you.

**17**  Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?

**18** [✞] The children gather wood, the fathers kindle fire, [†](#Jer_CR361) and the women knead dough, to [†](#Jer_CR362) make cakes for [†](#Jer_CR363) the queen of heaven. And [†](#Jer_CR364) they pour out drink offerings to other gods, [†](#Jer_CR365) to provoke me to anger.

**19**  [†](#Jer_CR366) Is it I whom they provoke? declares the L**ORD**. Is it not themselves, [†](#Jer_CR367) to their own shame?

**20** [✞] Therefore thus says the Lord **GOD**: Behold, [†](#Jer_CR368) my anger and my wrath will be poured out on this place, upon man and beast, upon the trees of the field and the fruit of the ground; [†](#Jer_CR369) it will burn and not be quenched.”

**21** [✞] Thus says the L**ORD** of hosts, the God of Israel: [†](#Jer_CR370) “Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices, and eat the flesh.

**22**  For in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, I did not speak to your fathers or command them [†](#Jer_CR371) concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices.

**23**  But this command I gave them: [†](#Jer_CR372)‘Obey my voice, and [†](#Jer_CR373) I will be your God, and you shall be my people. [†](#Jer_CR374) And walk in all the way that I command you, [†](#Jer_CR375) that it may be well with you.’

**24** [✞] [†](#Jer_CR376) But they did not obey or incline their ear, [†](#Jer_CR377) but walked in their own counsels and [†](#Jer_CR378) the stubbornness of their evil hearts, and [†](#Jer_CR379) went backward and not forward.

**25** [✞] From the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt to this day, [†](#Jer_CR380) I have persistently sent all my servants the prophets to them, day after day.

**26**  [†](#Jer_CR381) Yet they did not listen to me or incline their ear, [†](#Jer_CR382) but stiffened their neck. [†](#Jer_CR383) They did worse than their fathers.

**27**  [†](#Jer_CR384) “So you shall speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you. [†](#Jer_CR385) You shall call to them, but they will not answer you.

**28**  And you shall say to them, ‘This is the nation that did not obey the voice of the L**ORD** their God, and did not accept discipline; [†](#Jer_CR386) truth has perished; it is cut off from their lips.

> **29** [✞] [†](#Jer_CR387) “‘Cut off your hair and cast it away;

  > raise a lamentation on [†](#Jer_CR388) the bare heights,

> for the L**ORD** has rejected and forsaken

  > the generation of his wrath.’

**30** [✞] “For the sons of Judah have done evil in my sight, declares the L**ORD**. They have set [†](#Jer_CR389) their detestable things in the house [†](#Jer_CR390) that is called by my name, to [†](#Jer_CR389) defile it.

**31** [✞] And they have built the high places of [†](#Jer_CR391) Topheth, which is in [†](#Jer_CR392) the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, [†](#Jer_CR393) to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, [†](#Jer_CR394) which I did not command, nor did it come into my mind.

**32**  [†](#Jer_CR395) Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the L**ORD**, when it will no more be called [†](#Jer_CR396) Topheth, or [†](#Jer_CR397) the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter; [†](#Jer_CR398) for they will bury in Topheth, because there is no room elsewhere.

**33** [✞] [†](#Jer_CR399) And the dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the air, and for the beasts of the earth, [†](#Jer_CR400) and none will frighten them away.

**34**  [†](#Jer_CR401) And I will silence in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, [†](#Jer_CR402) for the land shall become a waste.8 “At that time, declares the L**ORD**, the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of its officials, the bones of the priests, the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be brought out of their tombs.

**2** [✞] And they shall be spread [†](#Jer_CR403) before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven, which they have loved and served, which they have gone after, and which they have sought and worshiped. [†](#Jer_CR404) And they shall not be gathered or buried. [†](#Jer_CR405) They shall be as dung on the surface of the ground.

**3** [✞] [†](#Jer_CR406) Death shall be preferred to life by all the remnant that remains of this evil family [†](#Jer_CR407) in all the places where I have driven them, declares the L**ORD** of hosts.

> **4** [✞] “You shall say to them, Thus says the L**ORD**:

> [†](#Jer_CR408) When men fall, do they not rise again?

  > If one turns away, does he not return?

> **5**  Why then has this people [†](#Jer_CR409) turned away

  > in perpetual [†](#Jer_CR410) backsliding?

> [†](#Jer_CR411) They hold fast to deceit;

  > falsehood and not truth has grown strong [*](#Jer_NC17) in the land;

> for they proceed from evil to evil,

  > [†](#Jer_CR452) and they do not know me, declares the L**ORD**.

> **4**  [†](#Jer_CR453) Let everyone beware of his neighbor,

  > and put no trust in any brother,

> for every [†](#Jer_CR454) brother is a deceiver,

  > and every neighbor [†](#Jer_CR455) goes about as a slanderer.

> **5**  Everyone deceives his neighbor,

  > and no one speaks the truth;

> they have taught their tongue to speak lies;

  > they weary themselves committing iniquity.

> **6**  Heaping oppression upon oppression, and deceit upon deceit,

  > [†](#Jer_CR456) they refuse to know me, declares the L**ORD**.

> **7** [✞] Therefore thus says the L**ORD** of hosts:

> “Behold, [†](#Jer_CR457) I will refine them and [†](#Jer_CR458) test them,

  > for what else can I do, [†](#Jer_CR459) because of my people?

> **8** [✞] [†](#Jer_CR460) Their tongue is a deadly arrow;

  > [†](#Jer_CR461) it speaks deceitfully;

> with his mouth [†](#Jer_CR462) each speaks peace to his neighbor,

  > but in his heart [†](#Jer_CR463) he plans an ambush for him.

> **9**  [†](#Jer_CR464) Shall I not punish them for these things? declares the L**ORD**,

  > and shall I not avenge myself

  > on a nation such as this?

> **10** [✞] “I will take up weeping and wailing for the mountains,

  > and a lamentation for [†](#Jer_CR465) the pastures of the wilderness,

> [†](#Jer_CR466) because they are laid waste so that no one passes through,

  > and the lowing of cattle is not heard;

> [†](#Jer_CR467) both the birds of the air and the beasts

  > have fled and are gone.

> **11** [✞] [†](#Jer_CR468) I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins,

  > [†](#Jer_CR469) a lair of jackals,

> [†](#Jer_CR470) and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation,

  > without inhabitant.”

**12** [✞] [†](#Jer_CR471) Who is the man so wise that he can understand this? To whom has the mouth of the L**ORD** spoken, that he may declare it? Why is the land ruined [†](#Jer_CR472) and laid waste like a wilderness, so that no one passes through?

**13** [✞] And the L**ORD** says: [†](#Jer_CR473) “Because they have forsaken my law that I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice or walked in accord with it,

**14** [✞] but [†](#Jer_CR474) have stubbornly followed their own hearts and have gone after the Baals, as their fathers taught them.

**15** [✞] Therefore thus says the L**ORD** of hosts, the God of Israel: [†](#Jer_CR475) Behold, I will feed this people with bitter food, and give them [†](#Jer_CR476) poisonous water to drink.

**16** [✞] [†](#Jer_CR477) I will scatter them among the nations [†](#Jer_CR478) whom neither they nor their fathers have known, and I will [†](#Jer_CR479) send the sword after them, until I have consumed them.”

> **17** [✞] Thus says the L**ORD** of hosts:

> [†](#Jer_CR480) “Consider, and call for the mourning women to come;

  > send for the skillful women to come;

> **18**  let them make haste [†](#Jer_CR481) and raise a wailing over us,

  > [†](#Jer_CR482) that our eyes may run down with tears

  > and our eyelids flow with water.

> **19**  For a sound of wailing is heard from Zion:

  > [†](#Jer_CR483)‘How we are ruined!

  > We are utterly shamed,

> because we have left the land,

  > because they have cast down our dwellings.’”

> **20**  Hear, O women, the word of the L**ORD**,

  > and let your ear receive the word of his mouth;

> teach to your daughters a lament,

  > and each to her neighbor a dirge.

> **21** [✞] For death has come up into our windows;

  > it has entered our palaces,

> [†](#Jer_CR484) cutting off the children from the streets

  > and the young men from the squares.

> **22**  Speak: “Thus declares the L**ORD**,

> [†](#Jer_CR485)‘The dead bodies of men shall fall

  > like dung upon the open field,

> [†](#Jer_CR486) like sheaves after the reaper,

  > and none shall gather them.’”

**23** [✞] Thus says the L**ORD**: [†](#Jer_CR487) “Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, let not the mighty man boast in his might, let not the rich man boast in his riches,

**24** [✞] but [†](#Jer_CR488) let him who boasts boast in this, that he understands and knows me, that I am the L**ORD** who practices steadfast love, justice, and righteousness in the earth. [†](#Jer_CR489) For in these things I delight, declares the L**ORD**.”

**25** [✞] “Behold, the days are coming, declares the L**ORD**, when [†](#Jer_CR490) I will punish all those who are circumcised merely in the flesh—

**26** [✞] [†](#Jer_CR491) Egypt, Judah, Edom, the sons of Ammon, Moab, and [†](#Jer_CR492) all who dwell in the desert who cut the corners of their hair, for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are [†](#Jer_CR493) uncircumcised in heart.”
