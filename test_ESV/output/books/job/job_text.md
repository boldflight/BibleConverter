## SATAN

I n Scripture, the term _Satan_ means “adversary.” We know him as the devil. He is a high angelic creature who, before the creation of the human race, rebelled against God and has since battled with human beings and God. He is called the prince of darkness, the father of lies, the accuser, and the beguiling serpent. The real portrait is nothing like the horned, trident-bearing, comedic adversary to which we have become accustomed. That image, at least in part, arose out of the medieval church. The silly picture of Satan was intentionally created by the church in order to poke fun at him. The church was convinced that an effective ploy to withstand Satan was to insult him. His most vulnerable part was seen as his pride. To attack his pride was seen as an effective way to repel him.

The biblical view of Satan is far more sophisticated. He appears as an “angel of light.” That image points to Satan’s clever ability to manifest himself under the appearance of good. Satan is subtle, beguiling, and crafty. He speaks with eloquence; his appearance is stunning. The prince of darkness wears a cloak of light. Scripture also speaks of Satan as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. Christ is also referred to as a lion, the Lion of Judah. He is a redeemer, the anti-lion and devourer. Both images speak of strength.

How, then, should the believer react to Satan? On the one hand Satan is indeed fearsome. In 1 Peter 5:8 we are told that “your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.” The believer is not to respond, however, in sheer terror. Satan may be stronger than we are, but Christ is stronger than Satan. The Bible declares, “He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world” (1 John 4:4). Satan is, after all, a creature. He is finite and limited. He is limited in space and time. He cannot be in more than one place at a time. He is never to be regarded in any way as an equal with God. Satan is a higher order of being than humans; he is a fallen angel. But he is not divine. He has more power than earthly creatures but infinitely less power than almighty God.

### JOB 1:1

1 [✞] There was a man in the land of [†](#Jb_CR1) Uz whose name was [†](#Jb_CR2) Job, and that man was [†](#Jb_CR3) blameless and upright, one who [†](#Jb_CR4) feared God and [†](#Jb_CR5) turned away from evil.

**2** [✞] There were born to him [†](#Jb_CR6) seven sons and three daughters.

**3** [✞] He possessed 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, and 500 female donkeys, and very many servants, so that this man was the greatest of all [†](#Jb_CR7) the people of the east.

**4** [✞] His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one on his day, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.

**5** [✞] And when the days of the feast had run their course, Job would send and [†](#Jb_CR8) consecrate them, and he would rise early in the morning and [†](#Jb_CR9) offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, “It may be that my children have sinned, and [†](#Jb_CR10) cursed [*](#Jb_NC1) God in their hearts.” Thus Job did continually.

**6** [✞] Now there was a day when [†](#Jb_CR11) the sons of God came to present themselves before the L**ORD**, and [†](#Jb_CR12) Satan [*](#Jb_NC2) also came among them.

**7** [✞] The L**ORD** said to Satan, “From where have you come?” Satan answered the L**ORD** and said, “From [†](#Jb_CR13) going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it.”

**8** [✞] And the L**ORD** said to Satan, “Have you [†](#Jb_CR14) considered my [†](#Jb_CR15) servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, [†](#Jb_CR16) a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil?”

**9** [✞] Then Satan answered the L**ORD** and said, “Does Job fear God for no reason?

**10** [✞] Have you not put [†](#Jb_CR17) a hedge around him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have [†](#Jb_CR18) blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.

**11** [✞] But [†](#Jb_CR19) stretch out your hand and [†](#Jb_CR20) touch all that he has, and he will [†](#Jb_CR21) curse you [†](#Jb_CR22) to your face.”

**12** [✞] And the L**ORD** said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has is in your hand. Only against him do not stretch out your hand.” So Satan went out from the presence of the L**ORD**.

**13** [✞] Now there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,

**14**  and there came a messenger to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them,

**15** [✞] and [†](#Jb_CR23) the Sabeans fell upon them and took them and struck down the servants [*](#Jb_NC3) with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”

**16**  While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, [†](#Jb_CR24) “The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”

**17** [✞] While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, [†](#Jb_CR25) “The Chaldeans formed [†](#Jb_CR26) three groups and made a raid on the camels and took them and struck down the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”

**18**  While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, [†](#Jb_CR27) “Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,

**19**  and behold, a great wind came across [†](#Jb_CR28) the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people, and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”

**20** [✞] Then Job arose and [†](#Jb_CR29) tore his [†](#Jb_CR30) robe and [†](#Jb_CR31) shaved his head [†](#Jb_CR32) and fell on the ground and worshiped.

**21**  And he said, [†](#Jb_CR33) “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked shall I [†](#Jb_CR34) return. The L**ORD** [†](#Jb_CR35) gave, and the L**ORD** has taken away; [†](#Jb_CR36) blessed be the name of the L**ORD**.”

**22**  [†](#Jb_CR37) In all this Job did not sin or charge God with [†](#Jb_CR38) wrong.2 [✞] Again [†](#Jb_CR39) there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the L**ORD**, and Satan also came among them to present himself before the L**ORD**.

**2**  And the L**ORD** said to Satan, “From where have you come?” Satan answered the L**ORD** and said, “From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it.”

**3** [✞] And the L**ORD** said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil? He still [†](#Jb_CR40) holds fast his integrity, although you incited me against him to destroy him [†](#Jb_CR41) without reason.”

**4** [✞] Then Satan answered the L**ORD** and said, “Skin for skin! All that a man has he will give for his life.

**5**  But [†](#Jb_CR42) stretch out your hand and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will [†](#Jb_CR43) curse you to your face.”

**6** [✞] And the L**ORD** said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your hand; only spare his life.”

**7** [✞] So Satan went out from the presence of the L**ORD** and struck Job with loathsome [†](#Jb_CR44) sores from [†](#Jb_CR45) the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.

**8** [✞] And he took [†](#Jb_CR46) a piece of broken pottery with which to scrape himself while he sat in [†](#Jb_CR47) the ashes.

**9** [✞] Then his wife said to him, “Do you still [†](#Jb_CR48) hold fast your integrity? [†](#Jb_CR49) Curse God and die.”

**10** [✞] But he said to her, “You speak as one of the [†](#Jb_CR50) foolish women would speak. [†](#Jb_CR51) Shall we receive good from God, and shall we not receive evil?” [*](#Jb_NC4) [†](#Jb_CR52) In all this Job did not [†](#Jb_CR53) sin with his lips.

**11** [✞] Now when Job’s three [†](#Jb_CR54) friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him, they came each from his own place, Eliphaz [†](#Jb_CR55) the Temanite, Bildad [†](#Jb_CR56) the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They made an appointment together to come to [†](#Jb_CR57) show him sympathy and comfort him.

**12** [✞] And when they saw him from a distance, they did not recognize him. And they raised their voices and wept, and they [†](#Jb_CR58) tore their robes and sprinkled [†](#Jb_CR59) dust on their heads toward heaven.

**13** [✞] And they sat with him on the ground [†](#Jb_CR60) seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his suffering was very great.3 [✞] After this Job [†](#Jb_CR61) opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.

**2**  And Job said:

> **3** [✞] [†](#Jb_CR62) “Let the day perish on which I was born,

  > and the night that said,

  > ‘ A man is conceived.’

> **4** [✞] Let that day be darkness!

  > May God above not seek it,

  > nor light shine upon it.

> **5**  Let gloom and [†](#Jb_CR63) deep darkness claim it.

  > Let clouds dwell upon it;

  > let the blackness of the day terrify it.

> **6**  That night—let thick darkness seize it!

  > Let it not rejoice among the days of the year;

  > let it not come into the number of the months.

> **7** [✞] Behold, let that night be barren;

  > let no joyful cry enter it.

> **8** [✞] Let those curse it who curse the day,

  > who are ready to rouse up [†](#Jb_CR64) Leviathan.

> **9** [✞] Let the stars of its dawn be dark;

  > let it hope for light, but have none,

  > nor see [†](#Jb_CR65) the eyelids of the morning,

> **10**  because it did not shut the doors of my mother’s womb,

  > nor hide trouble from my eyes.

> **11** [✞] “Why [†](#Jb_CR66) did I not die at birth,

  > come out from the womb and expire?

> **12** [✞] Why did [†](#Jb_CR67) the knees receive me?

  > Or why the breasts, that I should nurse?

> **13** [✞] For then I would have lain down and been quiet;

  > I would have slept; then I would have been at rest,

> **14**  with kings and counselors of the earth

  > who [†](#Jb_CR68) rebuilt ruins for themselves,

> **15**  or with princes who had gold,

  > who filled their houses with silver.

> **16** [✞] Or why was I not as a hidden [†](#Jb_CR69) stillborn child,

  > as infants who never see the light?

> **17** [✞] There the wicked cease from troubling,

  > and there the weary are at [†](#Jb_CR70) rest.

> **18**  There the prisoners are at ease together;

  > they hear not the voice of [†](#Jb_CR71) the taskmaster.

> **19**  The small and the great are there,

  > and the slave is free from his master.

> **20** [✞] “Why is light given to him who is in misery,

  > and life to [†](#Jb_CR72) the bitter in soul,

> **21**  who [†](#Jb_CR73) long for death, but it comes not,

  > and dig for it more than for [†](#Jb_CR74) hidden treasures,

> **22**  who rejoice exceedingly

  > and are glad when they find the grave?

> **23**  Why is light given to a man whose [†](#Jb_CR75) way is hidden,

  > whom God has [†](#Jb_CR76) hedged in?

> **24**  For my sighing comes [†](#Jb_CR77) instead of [*](#Jb_NC5) my bread,

  > and my [†](#Jb_CR78) groanings are poured out like water.

> **25** [✞] [†](#Jb_CR79) For the thing that I fear comes upon me,

  > and what I dread befalls me.

> **26**  I am not at ease, nor am I quiet;

  > I have no rest, but trouble comes.”

4 [✞] Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:

> **2** [✞] “If one ventures a word with you, will you be impatient?

  > Yet who can keep from speaking?

> **3**  Behold, you have instructed many,

  > and you have [†](#Jb_CR80) strengthened the weak hands.

> **4**  Your words have upheld him who was stumbling,

  > and you have [†](#Jb_CR81) made firm the feeble knees.

> **5**  But now it has come to you, and you are impatient;

  > it touches you, and you are dismayed.

> **6** [✞] [†](#Jb_CR82) Is not your fear of God [*](#Jb_NC6) your [†](#Jb_CR83) confidence,

  > and the integrity of your ways your hope?

> **7** [✞] “Remember: [†](#Jb_CR84) who that was innocent ever perished?

  > Or where were the upright cut off?

> **8** [✞] As I have seen, those who [†](#Jb_CR85) plow iniquity

  > and sow trouble reap the same.

> **9**  By [†](#Jb_CR86) the breath of God they perish,

  > and by [†](#Jb_CR87) the blast of his anger they are consumed.

> **10** [✞] The roar of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion,

  > [†](#Jb_CR88) the teeth of the young lions are broken.

> **11** [✞] The strong lion perishes for lack of prey,

  > and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.

> **12** [✞] “Now a word was brought to me stealthily;

  > my ear received [†](#Jb_CR89) the whisper of it.

> **13**  Amid [†](#Jb_CR90) thoughts from [†](#Jb_CR91) visions of the night,

  > when [†](#Jb_CR91) deep sleep falls on men,

> **14**  dread came upon me, and trembling,

  > which made all my bones shake.

> **15**  A spirit glided past my face;

  > the hair of my flesh stood up.

> **16**  It stood still,

  > but I could not discern its appearance.

> [†](#Jb_CR92) A form was before my eyes;

  > there was silence, then I heard [†](#Jb_CR93) a voice:

> **17** [✞] [†](#Jb_CR94) ‘Can mortal man be in the right before [*](#Jb_NC7) God?

  > Can a man be pure before his Maker?

> **18** [✞] Even in his servants [†](#Jb_CR95) he puts no trust,

  > and his angels he charges with error;

> **19** [✞] how much more those who dwell in houses of [†](#Jb_CR96) clay,

  > whose foundation is in [†](#Jb_CR97) the dust,

6 [✞] Then Job answered and said:

> **2** [✞] “Oh that my vexation were weighed,

8 [✞] Then [†](#Jb_CR187) Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:

> **2** [✞] “How long will you say these things,

  > and the words of your mouth be a [†](#Jb_CR188) great wind?

> **4** [✞] If your [†](#Jb_CR190) children have sinned against him,

  > he has delivered them into the hand of their transgression.

> **5**  If you will seek God

  > and [†](#Jb_CR191) plead with the Almighty for mercy,

> **6** [✞] if you are pure and upright,

  > surely then he will [†](#Jb_CR192) rouse himself for you

  > and [†](#Jb_CR193) restore your rightful habitation.

> **7**  And though your beginning was small,
