### An Invasion of Locusts

1 [✞] The word of the L**ORD** that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel:

> **2** [✞] [†](#Joeltext_EFN1) Hear this, [†](#Joeltext_EFN2) you elders;

  > give ear, [†](#Joeltext_EFN2) all inhabitants of the land!

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN3) Has such a thing happened in your days,

  > or in the days of your fathers?

> **3** [✞] [†](#Joeltext_EFN4) Tell your children of it,

  > and let your children tell their children,

  > and their children to another generation.

> **4** [✞] What [†](#Joeltext_EFN5) the cutting locust left,

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN6) the swarming locust has eaten.

> What the swarming locust left,

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN7) the hopping locust has eaten,

> and what the hopping locust left,

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN8) the destroying locust has eaten.

> **5** [✞] Awake, you drunkards, and weep,

  > and [†](#Joeltext_EFN9) wail, all you drinkers of wine,

> because of [†](#Joeltext_EFN10) the sweet wine,

  > for it is cut off from your mouth.

> **6** [✞] For [†](#Joeltext_EFN11) a nation has come up against my land,

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN11) powerful and beyond number;

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN12) its teeth are lions’ teeth,

  > and it has the fangs of a lioness.

> **7** [✞] It has laid waste my vine

  > and splintered my [†](#Joeltext_EFN13) fig tree;

> it has stripped off their bark and thrown it down;

  > their branches are made white.

> **8** [✞] Lament like a virgin [*](#Jl_NC1) [†](#Joeltext_EFN14) wearing sackcloth

  > for the bridegroom of her youth.

> **9** [✞] [†](#Joeltext_EFN15) The grain offering and the drink offering are cut off

  > from the house of the L**ORD**.

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN16) The priests mourn,

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN16) the ministers of the L**ORD**.

> **10** [✞] The fields are destroyed,

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN17) the ground mourns,

> because [†](#Joeltext_EFN18) the grain is destroyed,

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN18) the wine dries up,

  > the oil languishes.

> **11**  [†](#Joeltext_EFN19) Be ashamed, [*](#Jl_NC2) O tillers of the soil;

  > wail, O vinedressers,

> for the wheat and the barley,

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN20) because the harvest of the field has perished.

> **12** [✞] The vine dries up;

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN21) the fig tree languishes.

> Pomegranate, palm, and apple,

  > all the trees of the field are dried up,

> and [†](#Joeltext_EFN22) gladness dries up

  > from the children of man.

> **13** [✞] [†](#Joeltext_EFN23) Put on sackcloth and lament, [†](#Joeltext_EFN24) O priests;

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN25) wail, O ministers of the altar.

> Go in, [†](#Joeltext_EFN23) pass the night in sackcloth,

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN24) O ministers of my God!

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN26) Because grain offering and drink offering

  > are withheld from the house of your God.

> **14** [✞] [†](#Joeltext_EFN27) Consecrate a fast;

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN27) call a solemn assembly.

> Gather [†](#Joeltext_EFN28) the elders

  > and [†](#Joeltext_EFN28) all the inhabitants of the land

> to the house of the L**ORD** your God,

  > and cry out to the L**ORD**.

> **15** [✞] Alas for the day!

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN29) For the day of the L**ORD** is near,

  > and as destruction from the Almighty [*](#Jl_NC3) it comes.

> **16** [✞] Is not the food cut off

  > before our eyes,

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN30) joy and gladness

  > from the house of our God?

> **17**  [†](#Joeltext_EFN31) The seed shrivels under the clods; [*](#Jl_NC4)

  > the storehouses are desolate;

> the granaries are torn down

  > because [†](#Joeltext_EFN32) the grain has dried up.

> **18**  How [†](#Joeltext_EFN33) the beasts groan!

  > The herds of cattle are perplexed

> because there is no pasture for them;

  > even the flocks of sheep suffer. [*](#Jl_NC5)

> **19** [✞] To you, [†](#Joeltext_EFN34) O L**ORD**, I call.

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN35) For fire has devoured

  > the pastures of the wilderness,

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN35) and flame has burned

  > all the trees of the field.

> **20** [✞] Even the beasts of the field [†](#Joeltext_EFN36) pant for you

  > because the water brooks are dried up,

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN37) and fire has devoured

  > the pastures of the wilderness.

  > sound an alarm on [†](#Joeltext_EFN39) my holy mountain!

> Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,

  > for [†](#Joeltext_EFN40) the day of the L**ORD** is coming; it is near,

> **2** [✞] [†](#Joeltext_EFN41) a day of darkness and gloom,

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN41) a day of clouds and thick darkness!

> Like blackness there is spread upon the mountains

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN42) a great and powerful people;

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN43) their like has never been before,

  > nor will be again after them

  > through the years of all generations.

> **3** [✞] [†](#Joeltext_EFN44) Fire devours before them,

  > and behind them a flame burns.

> The land is like [†](#Joeltext_EFN45) the garden of Eden before them,

  > but [†](#Joeltext_EFN46) behind them a desolate wilderness,

  > and nothing escapes them.

> **4**  [†](#Joeltext_EFN47) Their appearance is like the appearance of horses,

  > and like war horses they run.

> **5** [✞] [†](#Joeltext_EFN48) As with the rumbling of chariots,

  > they leap on the tops of the mountains,

> like the crackling of [†](#Joeltext_EFN49) a flame of fire

  > devouring the stubble,

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN50) like a powerful army

  > drawn up for battle.

> **6**  Before them peoples are in anguish;

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN51) all faces grow pale.

> **7** [✞] Like warriors they charge;

  > like soldiers they scale the wall.

> They march each on his way;

  > they do not swerve from their paths.

> **8**  They do not jostle one another;

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN52) each marches in his path;

> they burst through the weapons

  > and are not halted.

> **9**  [†](#Joeltext_EFN53) They leap upon the city,

  > they run upon the walls,

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN54) they climb up into the houses,

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN54) they enter through the windows [†](#Joeltext_EFN55) like a thief.

> **10** [✞] [†](#Joeltext_EFN56) The earth quakes before them;

  > the heavens tremble.

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN57) The sun and the moon are darkened,

  > and the stars withdraw their shining.

> **11** [✞] [†](#Joeltext_EFN58) The L**ORD** utters his voice

  > before [†](#Joeltext_EFN59) his army,

> for his camp is exceedingly great;

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN60) he who executes his word is powerful.

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN61) For the day of the L**ORD** is [†](#Joeltext_EFN62) great and very awesome;

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN63) who can endure it?

> **12** [✞] “Yet even now,” declares the L**ORD**,

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN64) “return to me with all your heart,

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN65) with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning;

  > **13** [✞] and [†](#Joeltext_EFN66) rend your hearts and not [†](#Joeltext_EFN67) your garments.”

> Return to the L**ORD** your God,

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN68) for he is gracious and merciful,

> slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love;

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN69) and he relents over disaster.

> **14** [✞] [†](#Joeltext_EFN70) Who knows whether he will not turn and relent,

  > and [†](#Joeltext_EFN71) leave a blessing behind him,

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN72) a grain offering and a drink offering

  > for the L**ORD** your God?

> **15** [✞] [†](#Joeltext_EFN73) Blow the trumpet in Zion;

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN74) consecrate a fast;

> call a solemn assembly;

  > **16** [✞] gather the people.

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN75) Consecrate the congregation;

  > assemble the elders;

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN76) gather the children,

  > even nursing infants.

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN77) Let the bridegroom leave his room,

  > and the bride her chamber.

> **17** [✞] [†](#Joeltext_EFN78) Between the [†](#Joeltext_EFN79) vestibule and the [†](#Joeltext_EFN80) altar

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN81) let the priests, the ministers of the L**ORD**, weep

> and say, “Spare your people, O L**ORD**,

  > and make not your heritage a reproach,

  > a byword among the nations. [*](#Jl_NC6)

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN82) Why should they say among the peoples,

  > ‘Where is their God?’”

> **18** [✞] [†](#Joeltext_EFN83) Then the L**ORD** became jealous for his land

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN84) and had pity on his people.

> **19** [✞] The L**ORD** answered and said to his people,

> “Behold, [†](#Joeltext_EFN85) I am sending to you

  > grain, wine, and oil,

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN85) and you will be satisfied;

> and I will no more make you

  > a reproach among the nations.

> **20** [✞] “I will remove the northerner far from you,

  > and drive him into a parched and desolate land,

> his vanguard [*](#Jl_NC7) into [†](#Joeltext_EFN86) the eastern sea,

  > and his rear guard [*](#Jl_NC8) into [†](#Joeltext_EFN87) the western sea;

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN88) the stench and foul smell of him will rise,

  > for he has done great things.

> **21** [✞] “Fear not, O land;

  > be glad and rejoice,

  > for [†](#Joeltext_EFN89) the L**ORD** has done great things!

> **22**  Fear not, [†](#Joeltext_EFN90) you beasts of the field,

  > for [†](#Joeltext_EFN91) the pastures of the wilderness are green;

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN92) the tree bears its fruit;

  > the fig tree and [†](#Joeltext_EFN92) vine give their full yield.

> **23** [✞] [†](#Joeltext_EFN93) “Be glad, O children of Zion,

  > and [†](#Joeltext_EFN93) rejoice in the L**ORD** your God,

> for he has given [†](#Joeltext_EFN94) the early rain for your vindication;

  > he has poured down for you abundant rain,

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN94) the early and [†](#Joeltext_EFN95) the latter rain, as before.

> **24**  “The threshing floors shall be full of grain;

  > the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.

> **25** [✞] I will restore [*](#Jl_NC9) to you the years

  > that [†](#Joeltext_EFN96) the swarming locust has eaten,

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN96) the hopper, [†](#Joeltext_EFN96) the destroyer, and [†](#Joeltext_EFN96) the cutter,

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN97) my great army, which I sent among you.

> **26** [✞] [†](#Joeltext_EFN98) “You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied,

  > and praise the name of the L**ORD** your God,

  > who has dealt wondrously with you.

> And my people [†](#Joeltext_EFN99) shall never again be put to shame.

> **27** [✞] [†](#Joeltext_EFN100) You shall know that I am [†](#Joeltext_EFN101) in the midst of Israel,

  > and that [†](#Joeltext_EFN102) I am the L**ORD** your God [†](#Joeltext_EFN103) and there is none else.

> And my people [†](#Joeltext_EFN104) shall never again be put to shame.

> **28** [✞] [*](#Jl_NC10) [†](#Joeltext_EFN105) “And it shall come to pass afterward,

  > that [†](#Joeltext_EFN106) I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh;

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN107) your sons and [†](#Joeltext_EFN108) your daughters shall prophesy,

  > your old men shall dream dreams,

  > and your young men shall see visions.

> **29** [✞] [†](#Joeltext_EFN109) Even on the male and female servants

  > in those days I will pour out my Spirit.

**30** [✞] “And I will show [†](#Joeltext_EFN110) wonders in the heavens and [†](#Joeltext_EFN110) on the earth, blood and fire and columns of smoke.

**31** [✞] [†](#Joeltext_EFN111) The sun shall be turned to darkness, [†](#Joeltext_EFN112) and the moon to blood, [†](#Joeltext_EFN113) before the great and awesome day of the L**ORD** comes.

**32** [✞] And it shall come to pass that [†](#Joeltext_EFN114) everyone who calls on the name of the L**ORD** shall be saved. [†](#Joeltext_EFN115) For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those who escape, as the L**ORD** has said, and among [†](#Joeltext_EFN116) the survivors shall be those whom the L**ORD** calls.3 [✞] [*](#Jl_NC11) “For behold, [†](#Joeltext_EFN117) in those days and at that time, when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,

**2** [✞] [†](#Joeltext_EFN118) I will gather all the nations and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. And [†](#Joeltext_EFN119) I will enter into judgment with them there, on behalf of my people and my heritage Israel, because they have scattered them among the nations and have divided up my land,

**3** [✞] and [†](#Joeltext_EFN120) have cast lots for my people, and have traded a boy for a prostitute, and have sold a girl for wine and have drunk it.

**4** [✞] “What are you to me, [†](#Joeltext_EFN121) O Tyre and Sidon, and all [†](#Joeltext_EFN122) the regions of Philistia? Are you paying me back for something? If you are paying me back, [†](#Joeltext_EFN123) I will return your payment on your own head swiftly and speedily.

**5** [✞] For [†](#Joeltext_EFN124) you have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried my rich treasures into your temples. [*](#Jl_NC12)

**6**  You have sold [†](#Joeltext_EFN125) the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks in order to remove them far from their own border.

**7** [✞] Behold, I will stir them up from the place to which you have sold them, and [†](#Joeltext_EFN126) I will return your payment on your own head.

**8** [✞] I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the [†](#Joeltext_EFN127) Sabeans, to a nation far away, for the L**ORD** has spoken.”

> **9** [✞] Proclaim this among the nations:

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN128) Consecrate for war; [*](#Jl_NC13)

  > stir up the mighty men.

> Let all the men of war draw near;

  > let them come up.

> **10** [✞] [†](#Joeltext_EFN129) Beat your plowshares into swords,

  > and [†](#Joeltext_EFN129) your pruning hooks into spears;

  > let the weak say, “I am a warrior.”

> **11** [✞] [†](#Joeltext_EFN130) Hasten and come,

  > all you surrounding nations,

  > and gather yourselves there.

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN131) Bring down your warriors, O L**ORD**.

> **12**  Let the nations stir themselves up

  > and come up to [†](#Joeltext_EFN132) the Valley of Jehoshaphat;

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN133) for there I will sit to judge

  > all the surrounding nations.

> **13** [✞] [†](#Joeltext_EFN134) Put in the sickle,

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN135) for the harvest is ripe.

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN136) Go in, tread,

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN136) for the winepress is full.

> The vats overflow,

  > for their evil is great.

> **14** [✞] Multitudes, multitudes,

  > in the valley of decision!

> For [†](#Joeltext_EFN137) the day of the L**ORD** is near

  > in the valley of decision.

> **15** [✞] [†](#Joeltext_EFN138) The sun and the moon are darkened,

  > and the stars withdraw their shining.

> **16** [✞] [†](#Joeltext_EFN139) The L**ORD** roars from Zion,

  > and [†](#Joeltext_EFN139) utters his voice from Jerusalem,

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN140) and the heavens and the earth quake.

> But the L**ORD** is [†](#Joeltext_EFN141) a refuge to his people,

  > a stronghold to the people of Israel.

> **17** [✞] [†](#Joeltext_EFN142) “So you shall know that I am the L**ORD** your God,

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN143) who dwells in Zion, [†](#Joeltext_EFN144) my holy mountain.

> And Jerusalem shall be holy,

  > and [†](#Joeltext_EFN145) strangers shall never again pass through it.

> **18** [✞] “And in that day

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN146) the mountains shall drip sweet wine,

  > and the hills shall flow with milk,

> and [†](#Joeltext_EFN147) all the streambeds of Judah

  > shall flow with water;

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN148) and a fountain shall come forth from the house of the L**ORD**

  > and water the Valley of [†](#Joeltext_EFN149) Shittim.

> **19** [✞] [†](#Joeltext_EFN150) “Egypt shall become a desolation

  > and [†](#Joeltext_EFN151) Edom a desolate wilderness,

> [†](#Joeltext_EFN152) for the violence done to the people of Judah,

  > because they have shed innocent blood in their land.

> **20** [✞] [†](#Joeltext_EFN153) But Judah shall be inhabited forever,

  > and Jerusalem to all generations.

> **21**  [†](#Joeltext_EFN154) I will avenge their blood,

  > blood I have not avenged, [*](#Jl_NC14)

  > [†](#Joeltext_EFN155) for the L**ORD** dwells in Zion.”
