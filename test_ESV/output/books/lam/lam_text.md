  > the gates of Jerusalem.

> **13** [✞] This was for [†](#Lam_CR255) the sins of her prophets

  > and [†](#Lam_CR255) the iniquities of her priests,

> who shed in the midst of her

  > the blood of the righteous.

> **14** [✞] [†](#Lam_CR256) They wandered, blind, through the streets;

  > they were so defiled with blood

> [†](#Lam_CR257) that no one was able to touch

  > their garments.

> **15** [✞] “Away! [†](#Lam_CR258) Unclean!” people cried at them.

  > “Away! Away! Do not touch!”

> So they became fugitives and wanderers;

  > people said among the nations,

  > “They shall stay with us no longer.”

> **16**  [†](#Lam_CR259) The L**ORD** himself [*](#Lam_NC20) has scattered them;

  > he will regard them no more;

> [†](#Lam_CR260) no honor was shown to the priests,

  > [†](#Lam_CR261) no favor to the elders.

> **17** [✞] [†](#Lam_CR262) Our eyes failed, ever watching

  > [†](#Lam_CR262) vainly for help;

> in our watching we watched

  > for [†](#Lam_CR263) a nation which could not save.

> **18** [✞] [†](#Lam_CR264) They dogged our steps

  > so that we could not walk in our streets;

> [†](#Lam_CR265) our end drew near; our days were numbered,

  > for our end had come.

> **19** [✞] Our pursuers were [†](#Lam_CR266) swifter

  > than the eagles in the heavens;

> they chased us on the mountains;

  > they lay in wait for us in the wilderness.

> **20** [✞] [†](#Lam_CR267) The breath of our nostrils, [†](#Lam_CR268) the L**ORD**’s anointed,

  > was captured [†](#Lam_CR269) in their pits,

> of whom we said, [†](#Lam_CR270) “Under his shadow

  > we shall live among the nations.”

> **21** [✞] [†](#Lam_CR271) Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom,

  > you who dwell in [†](#Lam_CR272) the land of Uz;

> but to you also [†](#Lam_CR273) the cup shall pass;

  > you shall become drunk and strip yourself bare.

> **22** [✞] [†](#Lam_CR274) The punishment of your iniquity, O daughter of Zion, is accomplished;

  > he will keep you in exile no longer; [*](#Lam_NC21)

> but [†](#Lam_CR275) your iniquity, O daughter of Edom, he will punish;

  > he will uncover your sins.

  > look, and see [†](#Lam_CR277) our disgrace!

> **2** [✞] [†](#Lam_CR278) Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers,

  > our homes to foreigners.

> **3** [✞] We have become orphans, fatherless;

  > our mothers are like widows.

> **4** [✞] We must pay for the water we drink;

  > the wood we get must be bought.

> **5** [✞] [†](#Lam_CR279) Our pursuers are at our necks;

  > we are weary; we are given no rest.

> **6** [✞] We have given the hand to [†](#Lam_CR280) Egypt, and to [†](#Lam_CR280) Assyria,

  > to get bread enough.

> **7** [✞] Our fathers sinned, and are no more;

  > [†](#Lam_CR281) and we bear their iniquities.

> **8** [✞] [†](#Lam_CR282) Slaves rule over us;

  > there is none to deliver us from their hand.

> **9** [✞] [†](#Lam_CR283) We get our bread at the peril of our lives,

  > because of the sword in the wilderness.

> **10** [✞] [†](#Lam_CR284) Our skin is hot as an oven

  > with [†](#Lam_CR285) the burning heat of famine.

> **11** [✞] Women are raped in Zion,

  > young women in the towns of Judah.

> **12** [✞] [†](#Lam_CR286) Princes are hung up by their hands;

  > [†](#Lam_CR287) no respect is shown to the elders.

> **13** [✞] Young men are compelled to [†](#Lam_CR288) grind at the mill,

  > and boys stagger [†](#Lam_CR289) under loads of wood.

> **14** [✞] [†](#Lam_CR290) The old men have left the city gate,

  > the young men [†](#Lam_CR291) their music.

> **15** [✞] [†](#Lam_CR292) The joy of our hearts has ceased;

  > [†](#Lam_CR293) our dancing has been turned to mourning.

> **16** [✞] [†](#Lam_CR294) The crown has fallen from our head;

  > woe to us, for we have sinned!

> **17**  For this [†](#Lam_CR295) our heart has become sick,

  > for these things [†](#Lam_CR296) our eyes have grown dim,

> **18** [✞] for Mount Zion which lies desolate;

  > [†](#Lam_CR297) jackals prowl over it.

> **19** [✞] [†](#Lam_CR298) But you, O L**ORD**, reign forever;

  > your throne endures to all generations.

> **20** [✞] [†](#Lam_CR299) Why do you forget us forever,

  > why do you forsake us for so many days?

> **21** [✞] [†](#Lam_CR300) Restore us to yourself, O L**ORD**, that we may be restored!

  > Renew our days as of old—

> **22** [✞] [†](#Lam_CR301) unless you have utterly rejected us,

  > and you remain exceedingly angry with us.
