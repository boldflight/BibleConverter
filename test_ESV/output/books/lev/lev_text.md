## THE HOLINESS OF GOD

T wo virtues assigned to God, greatness and goodness, may be captured by one biblical word, _holy_ . When we speak of God’s holiness, we are accustomed to associating it almost exclusively with the purity and righteousness of God. Surely the idea of holiness contains these virtues, but they are not the primary meaning of holiness.

The biblical word _holy_ has two distinct meanings. The primary meaning is “apartness” or “otherness.” When we say that God is holy, we call attention to the profound difference between Him and all creatures. It refers to God’s transcendent majesty, His august superiority, by virtue of which He is worthy of our honor, reverence, adoration, and worship. He is “other” or different from us in His glory. When the Bible speaks of holy objects or holy people or holy time, it refers to things that have been set apart, consecrated, or made different by the touch of God upon them. The ground where Moses stood near the burning bush was holy ground because God was present there in a special way. It was the nearness of the divine that made the ordinary suddenly extraordinary and the common, uncommon.

The secondary meaning of _holy_ refers to God’s pure and righteous actions. God does what is right. He never does what is wrong. God always _acts_ in a righteous manner because His _nature_ is holy. Thus, we can distinguish between the _internal_ righteousness of God (His holy nature) and the _external_ righteousness of God (His actions).

Because God is holy, He is both great and good. There is no evil mixed in with His goodness. When we are called to be holy, it does not mean that we share in God’s divine majesty, but that we are to be different from our normal fallen sinfulness. We are called to mirror and reflect the moral character and activity of God. We are to imitate His goodness.

### Laws for Burnt Offerings

1 [✞] [†](#Lv_CR1) The L**ORD** called Moses and spoke to him [†](#Lv_CR2) from the tent of meeting, saying,

**2** [✞] “Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, [†](#Lv_CR3) When any one of you brings an offering to the L**ORD**, you shall bring your offering of livestock from the herd or from the flock.

**3** [✞] “If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he shall offer [†](#Lv_CR4) a male without blemish. He shall bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before the L**ORD**.

**4** [✞] [†](#Lv_CR5) He shall lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it shall be [†](#Lv_CR6) accepted for him [†](#Lv_CR7) to make atonement for him.

**5**  Then he shall kill the bull before the L**ORD**, and Aaron’s sons the priests shall bring the blood [†](#Lv_CR8) and throw the blood against the sides of the altar that is at the entrance of the tent of meeting.

**6**  Then he shall flay the burnt offering and cut it into pieces,

**7**  and the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar and [†](#Lv_CR9) arrange wood on the fire.

**8**  And Aaron’s sons the priests shall arrange the pieces, the head, and the fat, on the wood that is on the fire on the altar;

**9** [✞] but its entrails and its legs he shall wash with water. And the priest shall burn all of it on the altar, as [†](#Lv_CR10) a burnt offering, a food offering [*](#Lv_NC1) with a [†](#Lv_CR11) pleasing aroma to the L**ORD**.

**10** [✞] “If his gift for a burnt offering is from the flock, from the sheep or goats, he shall bring a male without blemish,

**11**  [†](#Lv_CR12) and he shall kill it on the north side of the altar before the L**ORD**, and Aaron’s sons the priests shall throw its blood against the sides of the altar.

**12**  And he shall cut it into pieces, with its head and its fat, and the priest shall arrange them on the wood that is on the fire on the altar,

**13**  but the entrails and the legs he shall wash with water. And the priest shall offer all of it and burn it on the altar; it is [†](#Lv_CR13) a burnt offering, a food offering with [†](#Lv_CR14) a pleasing aroma to the L**ORD**.

**14** [✞] “If his offering to the L**ORD** is a burnt offering of birds, then he shall bring his offering of [†](#Lv_CR15) turtledoves or pigeons.

**15**  And the priest shall bring it to the altar and wring off its head and burn it on the altar. Its blood shall be drained out on the side of the altar.

**16**  He shall remove its crop with its contents [*](#Lv_NC2) and cast it [†](#Lv_CR16) beside the altar on the east side, in the place for ashes.

**17**  He shall tear it open by its wings, but [†](#Lv_CR17) shall not sever it completely. And the priest shall burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire. It is a burnt offering, a food offering with a pleasing aroma to the L**ORD**.2 [✞] “When anyone brings a [†](#Lv_CR18) grain offering as an offering to the L**ORD**, his offering shall be of fine flour. [†](#Lv_CR19) He shall pour oil on it and put frankincense on it

**2** [✞] and bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests. And he shall take from it a handful of the fine flour and oil, with all of its frankincense, and the priest shall burn this as its [†](#Lv_CR20) memorial portion on the altar, a food [†](#Lv_CR21) offering with a pleasing aroma to the L**ORD**.

**3**  But the [†](#Lv_CR22) rest of the grain offering shall be for Aaron and his sons; [†](#Lv_CR23) it is a most holy part of the L**ORD**’s food offerings.

**4**  “When you bring a grain offering baked in the oven as an offering, it shall be [†](#Lv_CR24) unleavened loaves of fine flour mixed with oil or unleavened wafers smeared with oil.

**5**  And if your offering is a grain offering [†](#Lv_CR25) baked on a griddle, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mixed with oil.

**6**  You shall break it in pieces and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering.

**7**  And if your offering is a grain offering cooked in a pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.

**8**  And you shall bring the grain offering that is made of these things to the L**ORD**, and when it is presented to the priest, he shall bring it to the altar.

**9**  And the priest shall take from the grain offering its memorial portion and burn this on the altar, a food [†](#Lv_CR26) offering with a [†](#Lv_CR27) pleasing aroma to the L**ORD**.

**10**  But the [†](#Lv_CR28) rest of the grain offering shall be for Aaron and his sons; [†](#Lv_CR28) it is a most holy part of the L**ORD**’s food offerings.

**11** [✞] “No grain offering that you bring to the L**ORD** shall be made with [†](#Lv_CR29) leaven, for you shall burn no leaven nor any honey as a food offering to the L**ORD**.

**12**  [†](#Lv_CR30) As an offering of firstfruits you may bring them to the L**ORD**, but they shall not be offered on the altar for a pleasing aroma.

**13** [✞] You [†](#Lv_CR31) shall season all your grain offerings with salt. You shall not let the [†](#Lv_CR32) salt of the covenant with your God be missing from your grain offering; [†](#Lv_CR33) with all your offerings you shall offer salt.

**14** [✞] “If you offer a grain offering of firstfruits to the L**ORD**, you shall offer for the grain offering of your firstfruits fresh [†](#Lv_CR34) ears, roasted with fire, crushed new grain.

**15**  And [†](#Lv_CR35) you shall put oil on it and lay frankincense on it; it is a grain offering.

**16**  And the priest shall burn as its [†](#Lv_CR36) memorial portion some of the crushed grain and some of the oil with all of its frankincense; it is a food offering to the L**ORD**.3 [✞] “If his offering is [†](#Lv_CR37) a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offers an animal from the herd, male or female, [†](#Lv_CR38) he shall offer it [†](#Lv_CR39) without blemish before the L**ORD**.

**2**  And [†](#Lv_CR40) he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering and kill it at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and Aaron’s sons the priests shall throw the blood against the sides of the altar.

**3** [✞] And from the sacrifice of the peace offering, as a food offering to the L**ORD**, he shall offer [†](#Lv_CR41) the fat covering the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails,

**4** [✞] [†](#Lv_CR42) and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the long lobe of the liver that he shall remove with the kidneys.

**5**  Then Aaron’s sons [†](#Lv_CR43) shall burn it on the altar on top of the burnt offering, which is on the wood on the fire; it is a food offering with a pleasing aroma to the L**ORD**.

**6**  “If his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering to the L**ORD** is an animal from the flock, male or female, he shall offer it [†](#Lv_CR44) without blemish.

**7**  If he offers a lamb for his offering, then he shall offer it before the L**ORD**,

**8**  lay his hand on the head of his offering, and kill it in front of the tent of meeting; and Aaron’s sons shall throw its blood against the sides of the altar.

**9**  Then from the sacrifice of the peace offering he shall offer as a food offering to the L**ORD** its fat; he shall remove the whole [†](#Lv_CR45) fat tail, cut off close to the backbone, and the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails

**10**  and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins and the long lobe of the liver that he shall remove [†](#Lv_CR46) with the kidneys.

**11** [✞] And the priest shall burn it on the altar as [†](#Lv_CR47) a food offering to the L**ORD**.

**12**  “If his offering is a goat, then he shall offer it before the L**ORD**

**13**  and lay his hand on its head and kill it in front of the tent of meeting, and the sons of Aaron shall throw its blood against the sides of the altar.

**14**  Then he shall offer from it, as his offering for a food offering to the L**ORD**, the fat covering the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails

**15**  and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins and the long lobe of the liver that he shall remove [†](#Lv_CR48) with the kidneys.

**16**  And the priest shall burn them on the altar as a [†](#Lv_CR49) food offering with a pleasing aroma. [†](#Lv_CR50) All fat is the L**ORD**’s.

**17** [✞] It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations, in all your dwelling places, that you eat neither [†](#Lv_CR51) fat nor [†](#Lv_CR52) blood.”4 [✞] And the L**ORD** spoke to Moses, saying,

**2** [✞] “Speak to the people of Israel, saying, [†](#Lv_CR53) If anyone sins unintentionally [*](#Lv_NC3) in any of the L**ORD**’s commandments [†](#Lv_CR54) about things not to be done, and does any one of them,

**3** [✞] if it is the anointed priest who [†](#Lv_CR55) sins, thus bringing guilt on the people, then he shall offer for the sin that he has committed [†](#Lv_CR56) a bull from the herd without blemish to the L**ORD** for a sin offering.

**4**  He shall bring the bull to the [†](#Lv_CR57) entrance of the tent of meeting before the L**ORD** and lay his hand on the head of the bull and kill the bull before the L**ORD**.

**5**  And the anointed priest [†](#Lv_CR58) shall take some of the blood of the bull and bring it into the tent of meeting,

**6** [✞] and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and [†](#Lv_CR59) sprinkle part of the blood seven times before the L**ORD** in front of the veil of the sanctuary.

**7** [✞] And the priest [†](#Lv_CR60) shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense before the L**ORD** that is in the tent of meeting, and [†](#Lv_CR61) all the rest of the blood of the bull he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering that is at the entrance of the tent of meeting.

**8**  And all the fat of the bull of the sin offering he shall remove from it, [†](#Lv_CR62) the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails

**9**  [†](#Lv_CR63) and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins and the long lobe of the liver that he shall remove with the kidneys

**10**  (just as these are taken from the ox of the sacrifice of the peace offerings); and the priest shall burn them on the altar of burnt offering.

**11**  But [†](#Lv_CR64) the skin of the bull and all its flesh, with its head, its legs, its entrails, and its dung—

**12** [✞] all the rest of the bull—he shall carry [†](#Lv_CR65) outside the camp to a clean place, to the ash heap, and shall [†](#Lv_CR66) burn it up on a fire of wood. On the ash heap it shall be burned up.

**13** [✞] [†](#Lv_CR67) “If the whole congregation of Israel sins unintentionally [*](#Lv_NC4) and [†](#Lv_CR68) the thing is hidden from the eyes of the assembly, and they do any one of the things that by the L**ORD**’s commandments ought not to be done, and they realize their guilt, [*](#Lv_NC5)

**14**  [†](#Lv_CR69) when the sin which they have committed becomes known, the assembly shall offer a bull from the herd for a sin offering and bring it in front of the tent of meeting.

**15**  And the elders of the congregation [†](#Lv_CR70) shall lay their hands on the head of the bull before the L**ORD**, and the bull shall be killed before the L**ORD**.

**16**  Then [†](#Lv_CR71) the anointed priest shall bring some of the blood of the bull into the tent of meeting,

**17**  and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the L**ORD** in front of the veil.

**18**  And he shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar that is in the tent of meeting before the L**ORD**, and the rest of the blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering that is at the entrance of the tent of meeting.

**19**  And all its fat he shall take from it and burn on the altar.

**20**  Thus shall he do with the bull. As he did [†](#Lv_CR72) with the bull of the sin offering, so shall he do with this. [†](#Lv_CR73) And the priest shall make atonement for them, and they shall be forgiven.

**21**  And he shall carry the bull [†](#Lv_CR74) outside the camp and burn it up as he burned the first bull; it is the sin offering for the assembly.

**22** [✞] “When a leader sins, [†](#Lv_CR75) doing unintentionally any one of all the things that by the commandments of the L**ORD** his God ought not to be done, and realizes his guilt,

**23**  or [†](#Lv_CR76) the sin which he has committed is made known to him, he shall bring as his offering a goat, a male without blemish,

**24**  and [†](#Lv_CR77) shall lay his hand on the head of the goat and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the L**ORD**; it is a sin offering.

**25**  [†](#Lv_CR78) Then the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering.

**26**  And all its fat he shall burn on the altar, like [†](#Lv_CR79) the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings. So [†](#Lv_CR80) the priest shall make atonement for him for his sin, and he shall be forgiven.

**27** [✞] “If [†](#Lv_CR81) anyone of the common people sins unintentionally in doing any one of the things that by the L**ORD**’s commandments ought not to be done, and realizes his guilt,

**28**  [†](#Lv_CR82) or the sin which he has committed is made known to him, he shall bring for his offering a goat, a female without blemish, for his sin which he has committed.

**29**  [†](#Lv_CR83) And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and kill the sin offering in the place of burnt offering.

**30**  And the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out all the rest of its blood at the base of the altar.

**31**  And [†](#Lv_CR84) all its fat he shall remove, [†](#Lv_CR85) as the fat is removed from the peace offerings, and the priest shall burn it on the altar for a [†](#Lv_CR86) pleasing aroma to the L**ORD**. [†](#Lv_CR87) And the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiven.

**32**  “If he brings a lamb as his offering for a sin offering, he shall bring [†](#Lv_CR88) a female without blemish

**33**  [†](#Lv_CR89) and lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and kill it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering.

**34**  Then the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out all the rest of its blood at the base of the altar.

**35**  And all its fat he shall remove [†](#Lv_CR90) as the fat of the lamb is removed from the sacrifice of peace offerings, and the priest shall burn it on the altar, on top of the L**ORD**’s food offerings. [†](#Lv_CR91) And the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin which he has committed, and he shall be forgiven.5 [✞] “If anyone sins in that he hears a public [†](#Lv_CR92) adjuration to testify, and though he is a witness, whether he has seen or come to know the matter, yet does not speak, he shall [†](#Lv_CR93) bear his iniquity;

**2** [✞] or [†](#Lv_CR94) if anyone touches an unclean thing, whether a carcass of an unclean wild animal or a carcass of unclean livestock or a carcass of unclean swarming things, and it is hidden from him and he has become unclean, and he realizes his guilt;

**3**  or if he touches [†](#Lv_CR95) human uncleanness, of whatever sort the uncleanness may be with which one becomes unclean, and it is hidden from him, when he comes to know it, and realizes his guilt;

**4**  or if anyone utters with his lips a [†](#Lv_CR96) rash oath to do evil or to do good, any sort of rash oath that people [†](#Lv_CR97) swear, and it is hidden from him, when he comes to know it, and he realizes his guilt in any of these;

**5** [✞] when he realizes his guilt in any of these and [†](#Lv_CR98) confesses the sin he has committed,

**6**  he shall bring to the L**ORD** as his compensation [*](#Lv_NC6) for the sin that he has committed, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin offering. And the priest shall make atonement for him for his sin.

**7** [✞] “But [†](#Lv_CR99) if he cannot afford a lamb, then he shall bring to the L**ORD** as his compensation for the sin that he has committed two [†](#Lv_CR100) turtledoves or two pigeons, [*](#Lv_NC7) one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.

**8**  He shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer first the one for the sin offering. He shall [†](#Lv_CR101) wring its head from its neck [†](#Lv_CR101) but shall not sever it completely,

**9**  and he shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, while [†](#Lv_CR102) the rest of the blood shall be drained out [†](#Lv_CR103) at the base of the altar; it is a sin offering.

**10** [✞] Then he shall offer the second for a burnt offering according to the rule. [†](#Lv_CR104) And the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin that he has committed, and he shall be forgiven.

**11** [✞] “But if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two pigeons, then he shall bring as his offering for the sin that he has committed a [†](#Lv_CR105) tenth of an ephah [*](#Lv_NC8) of fine flour for a sin offering. He [†](#Lv_CR105) shall put no oil on it and shall put no frankincense on it, for it is a sin offering.

**12**  And he shall bring it to [†](#Lv_CR106) the priest, and the priest shall take a handful of it as its memorial portion and [†](#Lv_CR107) burn this on the altar, on the L**ORD**’s food offerings; it is a sin offering.

**13**  Thus [†](#Lv_CR108) the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin which he has committed in any one of these things, and he shall be forgiven. And the remainder [*](#Lv_NC9) shall be for the priest, as in the grain offering.”

**14** [✞] The L**ORD** spoke to Moses, saying,

**15**  [†](#Lv_CR109) “If anyone commits a breach of faith and sins unintentionally in any of the holy things of the L**ORD**, [†](#Lv_CR110) he shall bring to the L**ORD** as his compensation, a ram without blemish out of the flock, valued [*](#Lv_NC10) in silver shekels, [*](#Lv_NC11) according to the [†](#Lv_CR111) shekel of the sanctuary, for a guilt offering.

**16** [✞] He shall also make restitution for what he has done amiss in the holy thing and [†](#Lv_CR112) shall add a fifth to it and give it to the priest. [†](#Lv_CR113) And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering, and he shall be forgiven.

**17** [✞] [†](#Lv_CR114) “If anyone sins, doing any of the things that by the L**ORD**’s commandments ought not to be done, [†](#Lv_CR115) though he did not know it, then realizes his guilt, he shall bear his iniquity.

**18**  [†](#Lv_CR116) He shall bring to the priest a ram without blemish out of the flock, or its equivalent, for a guilt offering, and [†](#Lv_CR117) the priest shall make atonement for him for the mistake that he made unintentionally, and he shall be forgiven.

**19**  It is a guilt offering; he has indeed incurred guilt before [*](#Lv_NC12) the L**ORD**.”6 [✞][*](#Lv_NC13) The L**ORD** spoke to Moses, saying,

**2**  “If anyone sins and [†](#Lv_CR118) commits a breach of faith against the L**ORD** by [†](#Lv_CR119) deceiving his neighbor in [†](#Lv_CR120) a matter of deposit or security, or through robbery, or [†](#Lv_CR121) if he has oppressed his neighbor

**3**  or [†](#Lv_CR122) has found something lost and lied about it, [†](#Lv_CR123) swearing falsely—in any of all the things that people do and sin thereby—

**4**  if he has sinned and has realized his guilt and will restore [†](#Lv_CR124) what he took by robbery or what he got by oppression or the deposit that was committed to him or the lost thing that he found

**5**  or anything about which he has sworn falsely, he shall [†](#Lv_CR125) restore it in full and shall add a fifth to it, and give it to him to whom it belongs on the day he realizes his guilt.

**6**  And he shall bring to the priest as his compensation to the L**ORD** [†](#Lv_CR126) a ram without blemish out of the flock, or its equivalent, for a guilt offering.

**7**  [†](#Lv_CR127) And the priest shall make atonement for him before the L**ORD**, and he shall be forgiven for any of the things that one may do and thereby become guilty.”

**8** [✞] [*](#Lv_NC14) The L**ORD** spoke to Moses, saying,

**9** [✞] “Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering. The burnt offering shall be on the hearth on the altar all night until the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning on it.

**10** [✞] And [†](#Lv_CR128) the priest shall put on his linen garment and put his linen undergarment on his body, and he shall take up the ashes to which the fire has reduced the burnt offering on the altar and put them [†](#Lv_CR129) beside the altar.

**11**  Then [†](#Lv_CR130) he shall take off his garments and put on other garments and carry the ashes [†](#Lv_CR131) outside the camp to a clean place.

**12** [✞] The fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it; it shall not go out. The priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and he shall arrange the burnt offering on it and shall burn on it [†](#Lv_CR132) the fat of the peace offerings.

**13**  Fire shall be kept burning on the altar continually; it shall not go out.

**14**  “And this is the law of [†](#Lv_CR133) the grain offering. The sons of Aaron shall offer it before the L**ORD** in front of the altar.

**15**  And one shall take from it a handful of the fine flour of the grain offering and its oil and all the frankincense that is on the grain offering and burn this as its [†](#Lv_CR134) memorial portion on the altar, a pleasing aroma to the L**ORD**.

**16**  And [†](#Lv_CR135) the rest of it Aaron and his sons shall eat. It shall be eaten unleavened [†](#Lv_CR136) in a holy place. In the court of the tent of meeting they shall eat it.

**17**  [†](#Lv_CR137) It shall not be baked with leaven. [†](#Lv_CR138) I have given it as their portion of my food offerings. [†](#Lv_CR139) It is a thing most holy, like the sin offering and the guilt offering.

**18** [✞] Every male among the children of Aaron may eat of it, as decreed forever throughout your generations, from the L**ORD**’s food offerings. Whatever touches them shall become holy.”

**19** [✞] The L**ORD** spoke to Moses, saying,

**20**  [†](#Lv_CR140) “This is the offering that Aaron and his sons shall offer to the L**ORD** on the day when he is anointed: a [†](#Lv_CR141) tenth of an ephah [*](#Lv_NC15) of fine flour as a regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half in the evening.

**21**  It shall be made with oil [†](#Lv_CR142) on a griddle. You shall bring it [†](#Lv_CR143) well mixed, in baked [*](#Lv_NC16) pieces like a grain offering, and offer it for a pleasing aroma to the L**ORD**.

**22** [✞] The priest from among Aaron’s sons, who is anointed to succeed him, shall offer it to the L**ORD** as decreed forever. [†](#Lv_CR144) The whole of it shall be burned.

**23**  Every grain offering of a priest shall be wholly burned. It shall not be eaten.”

**24** [✞] The L**ORD** spoke to Moses, saying,

**25**  “Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, [†](#Lv_CR145) This is the law of the sin offering. [†](#Lv_CR146) In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the L**ORD**; [†](#Lv_CR147) it is most holy.

**26**  [†](#Lv_CR148) The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. [†](#Lv_CR149) In a holy place it shall be eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting.

**27**  Whatever touches its flesh shall be holy, and when any of its blood is splashed on a garment, you shall wash that on which it was splashed in a holy place.

**28**  And [†](#Lv_CR150) the earthenware vessel in which it is boiled [†](#Lv_CR151) shall be broken. But if it is boiled in a bronze vessel, that shall be scoured and rinsed in water.

**29**  Every male among the priests may eat of it; [†](#Lv_CR152) it is most holy.

**30**  [†](#Lv_CR153) But no sin offering shall be eaten from which any blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place; it shall be burned up with fire.7 [✞] [†](#Lv_CR154) “This is the law of the [†](#Lv_CR155) guilt offering. [†](#Lv_CR156) It is most holy.

**2**  [†](#Lv_CR157) In the place where they kill the burnt offering they shall kill the guilt offering, and its blood shall be thrown against the sides of the altar.

**3**  And [†](#Lv_CR158) all its fat shall be offered, the fat tail, the fat that covers the entrails,

**4**  the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the long lobe of the liver that he shall remove [†](#Lv_CR159) with the kidneys.

**5**  The priest shall burn them on the altar as a food offering to the L**ORD**; it is a guilt offering.

**6**  [†](#Lv_CR160) Every male among the priests may eat of it. It shall be eaten in a holy place. [†](#Lv_CR161) It is most holy.

**7**  The [†](#Lv_CR162) guilt offering is just like the sin offering; there is one law for them. The priest who makes atonement with it shall have it.

**8**  And the priest who offers any man’s burnt offering shall have for himself the skin of the burnt offering that he has offered.

**9**  And [†](#Lv_CR163) every grain offering baked [†](#Lv_CR164) in the oven and all that is prepared [†](#Lv_CR165) on a pan or a griddle shall belong to the priest who offers it.

**10**  And every grain offering, mixed with oil or dry, shall be shared equally among all the sons of Aaron.

**11** [✞] “And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings that one may offer to the L**ORD**.

**12** [✞] If he offers it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the thanksgiving sacrifice [†](#Lv_CR166) unleavened loaves mixed with oil, unleavened wafers smeared with oil, and loaves of fine flour [†](#Lv_CR167) well mixed with oil.

**13**  [†](#Lv_CR168) With the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving he shall bring his offering with loaves of leavened bread.

**14**  And from it he shall offer one loaf from each offering, as a [†](#Lv_CR169) gift to the L**ORD**. [†](#Lv_CR170) It shall belong to the priest who throws the blood of the peace offerings.

**15**  And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings [†](#Lv_CR171) for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his offering. He shall not leave any of it until the morning.

**16** [✞] But [†](#Lv_CR172) if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow offering or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice, and on the next day what remains of it shall be eaten.

**17**  But what remains of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned up with fire.

**18**  If any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offering is eaten on the third day, he who offers it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be credited to him. It is [†](#Lv_CR173) tainted, and he who eats of it shall bear his iniquity.

**19**  “Flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten. It shall be burned up with fire. All who are clean may eat flesh,

**20** [✞] but the person who eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of the L**ORD**’s peace offerings [†](#Lv_CR174) while an uncleanness is on him, that person shall be cut off from his people.

**21**  And if anyone touches an unclean thing, whether [†](#Lv_CR175) human uncleanness or an [†](#Lv_CR176) unclean beast or any [†](#Lv_CR177) unclean detestable creature, and then eats some flesh from the sacrifice of the L**ORD**’s peace offerings, that person shall be cut off from his people.”

**22**  The L**ORD** spoke to Moses, saying,

**23**  “Speak to the people of Israel, saying, [†](#Lv_CR178) You shall eat no fat, of ox or sheep or goat.

**24**  The fat of an animal [†](#Lv_CR179) that dies of itself and the fat of one that is torn by beasts may be put to any other use, but on no account shall you eat it.

**25** [✞] For every person who eats of the fat of an animal of which a food offering may be made to the L**ORD** shall be cut off from his people.

**26** [✞] Moreover, [†](#Lv_CR180) you shall eat no blood whatever, whether of fowl or of animal, in any of your dwelling places.

**27**  Whoever eats any blood, that person shall be cut off from his people.”

**28**  The L**ORD** spoke to Moses, saying,

**29**  “Speak to the people of Israel, saying, [†](#Lv_CR181) Whoever offers the sacrifice of his peace offerings to the L**ORD** shall bring his offering to the L**ORD** from the sacrifice of his peace offerings.

**30**  [†](#Lv_CR182) His own hands shall bring the L**ORD**’s food offerings. He shall bring the fat with [†](#Lv_CR183) the breast, that the breast may be waved as a wave offering before the L**ORD**.

**31**  [†](#Lv_CR184) The priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but [†](#Lv_CR185) the breast shall be for Aaron and his sons.

**32**  And [†](#Lv_CR186) the right thigh you shall give to the priest as a contribution from the sacrifice of your peace offerings.

**33**  Whoever among the sons of Aaron offers the blood of the peace offerings and the fat shall have the right thigh for a portion.

**34**  For the breast that is [†](#Lv_CR187) waved and the thigh that is [†](#Lv_CR187) contributed I have taken from the people of Israel, out of the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and [†](#Lv_CR188) have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons, as a perpetual due from the people of Israel.

**35**  This is the portion of Aaron and of his sons from the L**ORD**’s food offerings, from the day they were presented to serve as priests of the L**ORD**.

**36**  The L**ORD** commanded this to be given them by the people of Israel, [†](#Lv_CR189) from the day that he anointed them. It is a perpetual due throughout their generations.”

**37**  This is the law [†](#Lv_CR190) of the burnt offering, of the grain offering, of the sin offering, [†](#Lv_CR191) of the guilt offering, [†](#Lv_CR192) of the ordination offering, and [†](#Lv_CR193) of the peace offering,

**38**  which the L**ORD** commanded Moses on Mount Sinai, on the day that he commanded the people of Israel [†](#Lv_CR194) to bring their offerings to the L**ORD**, in the wilderness of Sinai.8 [✞] [†](#Lv_CR195) The L**ORD** spoke to Moses, saying,

**2**  “Take Aaron and his sons with him, and [†](#Lv_CR196) the garments and [†](#Lv_CR197) the anointing oil and the bull of the sin offering and the two rams and the basket of unleavened bread.

**3** [✞] And assemble all the congregation at the entrance of the tent of meeting.”

**4**  And Moses did as the L**ORD** commanded him, and the congregation was assembled at the entrance of the tent of meeting.

**5**  And Moses said to the congregation, [†](#Lv_CR198) “This is the thing that the L**ORD** has commanded to be done.”

**6**  And Moses brought Aaron and his sons and washed them with water.

**7** [✞] And he put [†](#Lv_CR199) the coat on him and tied the sash around his waist and clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him and tied the skillfully woven band of the ephod around him, binding it to him with the band. [*](#Lv_NC17)

**8** [✞] And he placed the breastpiece on him, and [†](#Lv_CR200) in the breastpiece he put the Urim and the Thummim.

**9**  And he set [†](#Lv_CR201) the turban on his head, and [†](#Lv_CR202) on the turban, in front, he set the golden plate, the holy crown, as the L**ORD** commanded Moses.

**10**  [†](#Lv_CR203) Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and consecrated them.

**11**  And he sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its utensils and the basin and its stand, to consecrate them.

**12**  And [†](#Lv_CR204) he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him to consecrate him.

**13**  And Moses brought Aaron’s sons and clothed them with coats and tied sashes around their waists and bound caps on them, as the L**ORD** commanded Moses.

**14**  Then he brought [†](#Lv_CR205) the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons [†](#Lv_CR206) laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering.

**15**  And he [*](#Lv_NC18) killed it, and [†](#Lv_CR207) Moses took the blood, and with his finger put it on the horns of the altar around it and purified the altar and poured out the blood at the base of the altar and consecrated it to make atonement for it.

**16**  [†](#Lv_CR208) And he took all the fat that was on the entrails and the long lobe of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat, and Moses burned them on the altar.

**17**  But [†](#Lv_CR209) the bull and its skin and its flesh and its dung he burned up with fire outside the camp, as the L**ORD** commanded Moses.

**18**  [†](#Lv_CR210) Then he presented the ram of the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.

**19**  And he killed it, and Moses threw the blood against the sides of the altar.

**20**  He cut the ram into pieces, and Moses burned [†](#Lv_CR211) the head and the pieces and the fat.

**21**  He washed the entrails and the legs with water, and Moses burned the whole ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering with a pleasing aroma, a food offering for the L**ORD**, as the L**ORD** commanded Moses.

**22**  Then [†](#Lv_CR212) he presented the other ram, the ram of ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.

**23** [✞] And he killed it, and Moses took some of its blood and [†](#Lv_CR213) put it on the lobe of Aaron’s right ear and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.

**24**  Then he presented Aaron’s sons, and Moses put some of the blood on the lobes of their right ears and on the thumbs of their right hands and on the big toes of their right feet. And Moses threw the blood against the sides of the altar.

**25**  Then he took the fat and the fat tail and all the fat that was on the entrails and the long lobe of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat and the right thigh,

**26**  and out of the basket of unleavened bread that was before the L**ORD** he took one unleavened loaf and one loaf of bread with oil and one wafer and placed them on the pieces of fat and on the right thigh.

**27**  And he put all these in the hands of Aaron and in the hands of his sons and waved them as a wave offering before the L**ORD**.

**28**  Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar with the burnt offering. This was an ordination offering with a pleasing aroma, a food offering to the L**ORD**.

**29**  And Moses took the breast and waved it for a wave offering before the L**ORD**. It was Moses’ portion of the ram of ordination, as the L**ORD** commanded Moses.

**30**  Then [†](#Lv_CR214) Moses took some of the anointing oil and of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron and his garments, and also on his sons and his sons’ garments. So he consecrated Aaron and his garments, and his sons and his sons’ garments with him.

**31**  And Moses said to Aaron and his sons, “Boil the flesh at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of ordination offerings, as I commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat it.’

**32**  And what remains of the flesh and the bread you shall burn up with fire.

**33**  And you shall not go outside the entrance of the tent of meeting for seven days, until the days of your ordination are completed, for it [†](#Lv_CR215) will take seven days to ordain you.

**34**  As has been done today, the L**ORD** has commanded to be done to make atonement for you.

**35**  At the entrance of the tent of meeting you shall remain day and night for seven days, performing what the L**ORD** has [†](#Lv_CR216) charged, so that you do not die, for so I have been commanded.”

**36**  And Aaron and his sons did all the things that the L**ORD** commanded by Moses.9 [✞] [†](#Lv_CR217) On the eighth day Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel,

**2**  and he said to Aaron, [†](#Lv_CR218) “Take for yourself a bull calf for a sin offering and [†](#Lv_CR219) a ram for a burnt offering, both without blemish, and offer them before the L**ORD**.

**3**  And say to the people of Israel, [†](#Lv_CR220) ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both a year old without blemish, for a burnt offering,

**4**  and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the L**ORD**, and [†](#Lv_CR221) a grain offering mixed with oil, for [†](#Lv_CR222) today the L**ORD** will appear to you.’”

**5**  And they brought what Moses commanded in front of the tent of meeting, and all the congregation drew near and stood before the L**ORD**.

**6**  And Moses said, “This is the thing that the L**ORD** commanded you to do, that the glory of the L**ORD** may appear to you.”

**7** [✞] Then Moses said to Aaron, “Draw near to the altar and [†](#Lv_CR223) offer your sin offering and your burnt offering and [†](#Lv_CR224) make atonement for yourself and for the people, and bring the offering of the people and make atonement for them, as the L**ORD** has commanded.”

**8**  So Aaron drew near to the altar and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.

**9**  [†](#Lv_CR225) And the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and [†](#Lv_CR226) put it on the horns of the altar and poured out the blood at the base of the altar.

**10**  [†](#Lv_CR227) But the fat and the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver from the sin offering he burned on the altar, [†](#Lv_CR228) as the L**ORD** commanded Moses.

**11**  [†](#Lv_CR229) The flesh and the skin he burned up with fire outside the camp.

**12**  Then he killed the burnt offering, and Aaron’s sons handed him the blood, and he [†](#Lv_CR230) threw it against the sides of the altar.

**13**  [†](#Lv_CR231) And they handed the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head, and he burned them on the altar.

**14**  [†](#Lv_CR232) And he washed the entrails and the legs and burned them with the burnt offering on the altar.

**15**  [†](#Lv_CR233) Then he presented the people’s offering and took the goat of the sin offering that was for the people and killed it and [†](#Lv_CR234) offered it as a sin offering, [†](#Lv_CR235) like the first one.

**16**  And he presented the burnt offering and offered it [†](#Lv_CR236) according to the [†](#Lv_CR237) rule.

**17**  And he presented the [†](#Lv_CR238) grain offering, took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar, [†](#Lv_CR239) besides the burnt offering of the morning.

**18**  Then he killed the ox and the ram, [†](#Lv_CR240) the sacrifice of peace offerings for the people. And Aaron’s sons handed him the blood, and he threw it against the sides of the altar.

**19**  But the fat pieces of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail and that which covers [†](#Lv_CR241) the entrails and the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver—

**20**  they put the fat pieces on the breasts, [†](#Lv_CR242) and he burned the fat pieces on the altar,

**21**  but the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved [†](#Lv_CR243) for a wave offering before the L**ORD**, as Moses commanded.

**22** [✞] Then Aaron [†](#Lv_CR244) lifted up his hands toward the people and [†](#Lv_CR245) blessed them, and he came down from offering the sin offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings.

**23** [✞] And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and when they came out they blessed the people, and [†](#Lv_CR246) the glory of the L**ORD** appeared to all the people.

**24**  And [†](#Lv_CR247) fire came out from before the L**ORD** and consumed the burnt offering and the pieces of fat on the altar, and when all the people saw it, [†](#Lv_CR248) they shouted and [†](#Lv_CR249) fell on their faces.10 [✞] Now [†](#Lv_CR250) Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, [†](#Lv_CR251) each took his censer and put fire in it and laid incense on it and offered [†](#Lv_CR252) unauthorized [*](#Lv_NC19) fire before the L**ORD**, which he had not commanded them.

**2** [✞] And fire [†](#Lv_CR253) came out from before the L**ORD** and consumed them, and they died before the L**ORD**.

**3**  Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what the L**ORD** has said: ‘Among [†](#Lv_CR254) those who are near me [†](#Lv_CR255) I will be sanctified, and before all the people I will be glorified.’” [†](#Lv_CR256) And Aaron held his peace.

**4**  And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of [†](#Lv_CR257) Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, “Come near; carry your brothers away from the front of the sanctuary and out of the camp.”

**5**  So they came near and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said.

**6** [✞] And Moses said to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar his sons, [†](#Lv_CR258) “Do not let the hair of your heads hang loose, and do not tear your clothes, lest you die, and [†](#Lv_CR259) wrath come upon all the congregation; but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning that the L**ORD** has kindled.

**7**  [†](#Lv_CR260) And do not go outside the entrance of the tent of meeting, lest you die, [†](#Lv_CR261) for the anointing oil of the L**ORD** is upon you.” And they did according to the word of Moses.

**8**  And the L**ORD** spoke to Aaron, saying,

**9**  [†](#Lv_CR262) “Drink no wine or strong drink, you or your sons with you, when you go into the tent of meeting, lest you die. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.

**10** [✞] You are to [†](#Lv_CR263) distinguish between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean,

**11**  and [†](#Lv_CR264) you are to teach the people of Israel all the statutes that the L**ORD** has spoken to them by Moses.”

**12**  Moses spoke to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his surviving sons: “Take the [†](#Lv_CR265) grain offering that is left of the L**ORD**’s food offerings, and eat it unleavened beside the altar, for [†](#Lv_CR266) it is most holy.

**13**  You shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your due and your sons’ due, from the L**ORD**’s food offerings, for [†](#Lv_CR267) so I am commanded.

**14**  But the [†](#Lv_CR268) breast that is waved and the thigh that is contributed you shall eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you, for they are given as your due and your sons’ due from the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the people of Israel.

**15**  [†](#Lv_CR269) The thigh that is contributed and the breast that is waved they shall bring with the food offerings of the fat pieces to wave for a wave offering before the L**ORD**, and it shall be yours and your sons’ with you as a due forever, as the L**ORD** has commanded.”

**16**  Now Moses diligently inquired about [†](#Lv_CR270) the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it was burned up! And he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the surviving sons of Aaron, saying,

**17** [✞] [†](#Lv_CR271) “Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary, since [†](#Lv_CR272) it is a thing most holy and has been given to you that you may bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the L**ORD**?

**18**  Behold, [†](#Lv_CR273) its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary. You certainly ought to have eaten it in the sanctuary, [†](#Lv_CR274) as I commanded.”

**19** [✞] And Aaron said to Moses, “Behold, [†](#Lv_CR275) today they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the L**ORD**, and yet such things as these have happened to me! If I had eaten the sin offering today, [†](#Lv_CR276) would the L**ORD** have approved?”

**20** [✞] And when Moses heard that, he approved.11 [✞] And the L**ORD** spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying to them,

**2** [✞] “Speak to the people of Israel, saying, [†](#Lv_CR277) These are the living things that you may eat among all the animals that are on the earth.

**3**  Whatever parts the hoof and is cloven-footed and chews the cud, among the animals, you may eat.

**4**  Nevertheless, among those that chew the cud or part the hoof, you shall not eat these: The camel, because it chews the cud but does not part the hoof, is unclean to you.

**5**  And the [†](#Lv_CR278) rock badger, because it chews the cud but does not part the hoof, is unclean to you.

**6**  And the hare, because it chews the cud but does not part the hoof, is unclean to you.

**7**  And the pig, because it parts the hoof and is cloven-footed but does not chew the cud, [†](#Lv_CR279) is unclean to you.

**8**  You shall not eat any of their flesh, and you shall not touch their carcasses; they are unclean to you.

**9** [✞] “These you may eat, of all that are in the waters. Everything in the waters that has fins and scales, whether in the seas or in the rivers, you may eat.

**10**  But anything in the seas or the rivers that does not have fins and scales, of the swarming creatures in the waters and of the living creatures that are in the waters, is [†](#Lv_CR280) detestable to you.

**11**  You shall regard them as detestable; you shall not eat any of their flesh, and you shall detest their carcasses.

**12**  Everything in the waters that does not have fins and scales is detestable to you.

**13** [✞] “And these you shall detest among the birds; [*](#Lv_NC20) they shall not be eaten; they are [†](#Lv_CR281) detestable: [†](#Lv_CR282) the eagle, [*](#Lv_NC21) the bearded vulture, the black vulture,

**14**  the kite, [†](#Lv_CR283) the falcon of any kind,

**15**  every raven of any kind,

**16**  the ostrich, the nighthawk, the sea gull, the [†](#Lv_CR284) hawk of any kind,

**17**  the [†](#Lv_CR285) little owl, the cormorant, the [†](#Lv_CR286) short-eared owl,

**18**  the barn owl, the [†](#Lv_CR287) tawny owl, the carrion vulture,

**19**  the stork, the heron of any kind, the hoopoe, and [†](#Lv_CR288) the bat.

**20** [✞] “All winged insects that go on all fours are detestable to you.

**21**  Yet among the winged insects that go on all fours you may eat those that have jointed legs above their feet, with which to hop on the ground.

**22**  Of them you may eat: [†](#Lv_CR289) the locust of any kind, the bald locust of any kind, the cricket of any kind, and the grasshopper of any kind.

**23**  But all other winged insects that have four feet are detestable to you.

**24**  “And by these you shall become unclean. Whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the evening,

**25**  and whoever carries any part of their carcass [†](#Lv_CR290) shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening.

**26**  Every animal that parts the hoof but is not cloven-footed or does not chew the cud is unclean to you. Everyone who touches them shall be unclean.

**27**  And all that walk on their paws, among the animals that go on all fours, are unclean to you. Whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the evening,

**28**  and he who carries their carcass [†](#Lv_CR291) shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening; they are unclean to you.

**29**  “And these are unclean to you among the swarming things that swarm on the ground: the mole rat, [†](#Lv_CR292) the mouse, the great lizard of any kind,

**30**  the gecko, the monitor lizard, the lizard, the sand lizard, and the chameleon.

**31**  These are unclean to you among all that swarm. Whoever touches them when they are dead shall be unclean until the evening.

**32**  And anything on which any of them falls when they are dead shall be unclean, whether it is an article of wood or a garment or a skin or a sack, any article that is used for any purpose. [†](#Lv_CR293) It must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the evening; then it shall be clean.

**33**  And if any of them falls into any earthenware vessel, all that is in it shall be unclean, and you [†](#Lv_CR294) shall break it.

**34**  Any food in it that could be eaten, on which water comes, shall be unclean. And all drink that could be drunk from every such vessel shall be unclean.

**35**  And everything on which any part of their carcass falls shall be unclean. Whether oven or stove, it shall be broken in pieces. They are unclean and shall remain unclean for you.

**36**  Nevertheless, a spring or a cistern holding water shall be clean, but whoever touches a carcass in them shall be unclean.

**37**  And if any part of their carcass falls upon any seed grain that is to be sown, it is clean,

**38**  but if water is put on the seed and any part of their carcass falls on it, it is unclean to you.

**39**  “And if any animal which you may eat dies, whoever touches its carcass shall be unclean until the evening,

**40**  and [†](#Lv_CR295) whoever eats of its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening. And whoever carries the carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening.

**41**  [†](#Lv_CR296) “Every swarming thing that swarms on the ground is detestable; it shall not be eaten.

**42**  Whatever goes on its belly, and whatever goes on all fours, or whatever has many feet, any swarming thing that swarms on the ground, you shall not eat, for they are detestable.

**43**  [†](#Lv_CR297) You shall not make yourselves detestable with any swarming thing that swarms, and you shall not defile yourselves with them, and become unclean through them.

**44** [✞] For I am the L**ORD** your God. Consecrate yourselves therefore, and [†](#Lv_CR298) be holy, for I am holy. [†](#Lv_CR299) You shall not defile yourselves with any swarming thing that crawls on the ground.

**45** [✞] [†](#Lv_CR300) For I am the L**ORD** who brought you up out of the land of Egypt to be your God. [†](#Lv_CR301) You shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.”

**46**  This is the law about beast and bird and every living creature that moves through the waters and every creature that swarms on the ground,

**47**  [†](#Lv_CR302) to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean and between the living creature that may be eaten and the living creature that may not be eaten.12 The L**ORD** spoke to Moses, saying,

**2** [✞] “Speak to the people of Israel, saying, If a woman conceives and bears a male child, then [†](#Lv_CR303) she shall be unclean seven days. [†](#Lv_CR304) As at the time of her menstruation, she shall be unclean.

**3**  And on the [†](#Lv_CR305) eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.

**4**  Then she shall continue for thirty-three days in the blood of her purifying. She shall not touch anything holy, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying are completed.

**5** [✞] But if she bears a female child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her menstruation. And she shall continue in the blood of her purifying for sixty-six days.

**6**  [†](#Lv_CR306) “And when the days of her purifying are completed, whether for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting a lamb a year old for a burnt offering, and a pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering,

**7**  and he shall offer it before the L**ORD** and make atonement for her. Then she shall be clean from the flow of her blood. This is the law for her who bears a child, either male or female.

**8** [✞] And if she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take [†](#Lv_CR307) two turtledoves or two pigeons, [*](#Lv_NC22) [†](#Lv_CR308) one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering. [†](#Lv_CR309) And the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.”13 [✞] The L**ORD** spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,

**2**  “When a person has on the skin of his body a [†](#Lv_CR310) swelling or an eruption or a spot, and it turns into a case of leprous [*](#Lv_NC23) disease on the skin of his body, [†](#Lv_CR311) then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons the priests,

**3**  and the priest shall examine the diseased area on the skin of his body. And if the hair in the diseased area has turned white and the disease appears to be deeper than the skin of his body, it is a case of leprous disease. When the priest has examined him, he shall pronounce him unclean.

**4**  But if the spot is white in the skin of his body and appears no deeper than the skin, and the hair in it has not turned white, [†](#Lv_CR312) the priest shall shut up the diseased person for seven days.

**5**  And the priest shall examine him on the seventh day, and if in his eyes the disease is checked and the disease has not spread in the skin, then the [†](#Lv_CR313) priest shall shut him up for another seven days.

**6**  And the priest shall examine him again on the seventh day, and if the diseased area has faded and the disease has not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is only an eruption. And [†](#Lv_CR314) he shall wash his clothes and be clean.

**7**  But if the eruption spreads in the skin, after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall appear again before the priest.

**8**  And the priest shall look, and if the eruption has spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a leprous disease.

**9**  “When a man is afflicted with a leprous disease, he shall be brought to the priest,

**10**  and the priest shall look. And if there is a [†](#Lv_CR315) white swelling in the skin that has turned the hair white, and there is raw flesh in the swelling,

**11**  it is a chronic leprous disease in the skin of his body, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean. [†](#Lv_CR316) He shall not shut him up, for he is unclean.

**12**  And if the leprous disease breaks out in the skin, so that the leprous disease covers all the skin of the diseased person from head to foot, so far as the priest can see,

**13**  then the priest shall look, and if the leprous disease has covered all his body, he shall pronounce him clean of the disease; it has all turned white, and he is clean.

**14**  But when raw flesh appears on him, he shall be unclean.

**15**  And the priest shall examine the raw flesh and pronounce him unclean. Raw flesh is unclean, for it is a leprous disease.

**16**  But if the raw flesh recovers and turns white again, then he shall come to the priest,

**17**  and the priest shall examine him, and if the disease has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce the diseased person clean; he is clean.

**18**  “If there is in the skin of one’s body a [†](#Lv_CR317) boil and it heals,

**19**  and in the place of the boil there comes a white swelling or a [†](#Lv_CR318) reddish-white spot, then it shall be shown to the priest.

**20**  And the priest shall look, and if it appears deeper than the skin and its hair has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is a case of leprous disease that has broken out in the boil.

**21**  But if the priest examines it and there is no white hair in it and it is not deeper than the skin, but has faded, then the priest shall shut him up seven days.

**22**  And if it spreads in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a disease.

**23**  But [†](#Lv_CR319) if the spot remains in one place and does not spread, it is the scar of the boil, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

**24**  “Or, when the body has a burn on its skin and the raw flesh of the burn becomes a spot, [†](#Lv_CR320) reddish-white or white,

**25**  the priest shall examine it, and if the hair in the spot has turned white and it appears deeper than the skin, then it is a leprous disease. It has broken out in the burn, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a case of leprous disease.

**26**  But if the priest examines it and there is no white hair in the spot and it is no deeper than the skin, but has faded, the priest shall shut him up seven days,

**27**  and the priest shall examine him the seventh day. If it is spreading in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a case of leprous disease.

**28**  But if the spot remains [†](#Lv_CR321) in one place and does not spread in the skin, but has faded, it is a swelling from the burn, and the priest shall pronounce him clean, for it is the scar of the burn.

**29**  “When a man or woman has a disease on the head or the beard,

**30**  the priest shall examine the disease. And if it appears deeper than the skin, and the hair in it is yellow and thin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is an itch, a leprous disease of the head or the beard.

**31**  And if the priest examines the itching disease and it appears no deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up the person with the itching disease for seven days,

**32**  and on the seventh day the priest shall examine the disease. If the itch has not spread, and there is in it no yellow hair, and the itch appears to be no deeper than the skin,

**33**  then he shall shave himself, but the itch he shall not shave; and the priest shall shut up the person with the itching disease for another seven days.

**34**  And on the seventh day the priest shall examine the itch, and if the itch has not spread in the skin and it appears to be no deeper than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean. And [†](#Lv_CR322) he shall wash his clothes and be clean.

**35**  But if the itch spreads in the skin after his cleansing,

**36**  then the priest shall examine him, and if the itch has spread in the skin, the priest need not seek for the yellow hair; he is unclean.

**37**  But if in his eyes the itch is unchanged and black hair has grown in it, the itch is healed and he is clean, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

**38**  “When a man or a woman has spots on the skin of the body, white spots,

**39**  the priest shall look, and if the spots on the skin of the body are of a dull white, it is leukoderma that has broken out in the skin; he is clean.

**40**  “If a man’s hair falls out from his head, he is bald; he is clean.

**41**  And if a man’s hair falls out from his forehead, he has baldness of the forehead; he is clean.

**42**  But if there is on the bald head or the bald forehead a reddish-white diseased area, it is a leprous disease breaking out on his bald head or his bald forehead.

**43**  Then the priest shall examine him, and if the diseased swelling is reddish-white on his bald head or on his bald forehead, like the appearance of leprous disease in the skin of the body,

**44**  he is a leprous man, he is unclean. The priest must pronounce him unclean; his disease is on his head.

**45**  “The leprous person who has the disease shall wear torn clothes and [†](#Lv_CR323) let the hair of his head hang loose, and he shall [†](#Lv_CR324) cover his upper lip [*](#Lv_NC24) and cry out, [†](#Lv_CR325) ‘Unclean, unclean.’

**46**  He shall remain unclean as long as he has the disease. He is unclean. He shall live alone. His dwelling shall be [†](#Lv_CR326) outside the camp.

**47**  “When there is a case of leprous disease in a [†](#Lv_CR327) garment, whether a woolen or a linen garment,

**48**  in warp or woof of linen or wool, or in a skin or in anything made of skin,

**49**  if the disease is greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin or in the warp or the woof or in any article made of skin, it is a case of leprous disease, and it shall be shown to the priest.

**50**  And the priest shall examine the disease and shut up that which has the disease for seven days.

**51**  Then he shall examine the disease on the seventh day. If the disease has spread in the garment, in the warp or the woof, or in the skin, whatever be the use of the skin, the disease is a [†](#Lv_CR328) persistent leprous disease; it is unclean.

**52**  And he shall burn the garment, or the warp or the woof, the wool or the linen, or any article made of skin that is diseased, for it is a persistent leprous disease. It shall be burned in the fire.

**53**  “And if the priest examines, and if the disease has not spread in the garment, in the warp or the woof or in any article made of skin,

**54**  then the priest shall command that they wash the thing in which is the disease, and he shall shut it up for another seven days.

**55**  And the priest shall examine the diseased thing after it has been washed. And if the appearance of the diseased area has not changed, though the disease has not spread, it is unclean. You shall burn it in the fire, whether the rot is on the back or on the front.

**56**  “But if the priest examines, and if the diseased area has faded after it has been washed, he shall tear it out of the garment or the skin or the warp or the woof.

**57**  Then if it appears again in the garment, in the warp or the woof, or in any article made of skin, it is spreading. You shall burn with fire whatever has the disease.

**58**  But the garment, or the warp or the woof, or any article made of skin from which the disease departs when you have washed it, shall then be washed a second time, and be clean.”

**59**  This is the law for a case of leprous disease in a garment of wool or linen, either in the warp or the woof, or in any article made of skin, to determine whether it is clean or unclean.14 The L**ORD** spoke to Moses, saying,

**2** [✞] “This shall be the law of the leprous person for the day of his cleansing. [†](#Lv_CR329) He shall be brought to the priest,

**3** [✞] and the priest shall go [†](#Lv_CR330) out of the camp, and the priest shall look. Then, if the case of leprous disease is healed in the leprous person,

**4**  the priest shall command them to take for him who is to be cleansed two live [*](#Lv_NC25) clean birds and [†](#Lv_CR331) cedarwood and [†](#Lv_CR332) scarlet yarn and [†](#Lv_CR333) hyssop.

**5**  And the priest shall command them to kill one of the birds in an earthenware vessel over fresh [*](#Lv_NC26) water.

**6**  He shall take the live bird with the cedarwood and the scarlet yarn and the hyssop, and dip them and the live bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the fresh water.

**7**  And he shall [†](#Lv_CR334) sprinkle it [†](#Lv_CR335) seven times on him who is to be cleansed of the leprous disease. Then he shall pronounce him clean and shall [†](#Lv_CR336) let the living bird go [†](#Lv_CR337) into the open field.

**8**  And he who is to be cleansed [†](#Lv_CR338) shall wash his clothes and shave off all his hair and bathe himself in water, and he shall be clean. And after that he may come into the camp, but [†](#Lv_CR339) live outside his tent seven days.

**9** [✞] And [†](#Lv_CR340) on the seventh day he shall shave off all his hair from his head, his beard, and his eyebrows. He shall shave off all his hair, and then he [†](#Lv_CR341) shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and he shall be clean.

**10**  “And on the eighth day he [†](#Lv_CR342) shall take two male lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish, and a [†](#Lv_CR343) grain offering of three tenths of an ephah [*](#Lv_NC27) of fine flour mixed with oil, and one log [*](#Lv_NC28) of oil.

**11**  And the priest who cleanses him shall set the man who is to be cleansed and these things before the L**ORD**, at the entrance of the tent of meeting.

**12**  And the priest shall take one of the male lambs and [†](#Lv_CR344) offer it for a guilt offering, along with the log of oil, and [†](#Lv_CR345) wave them for a wave offering before the L**ORD**.

**13**  And he shall kill the lamb [†](#Lv_CR346) in the place where they kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the place of the sanctuary. For [†](#Lv_CR347) the guilt offering, like the sin offering, belongs to the priest; [†](#Lv_CR348) it is most holy.

**14**  The priest shall take some of the blood of the guilt offering, and the priest shall put it [†](#Lv_CR349) on the lobe of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.

**15**  Then the priest shall take some of the log of oil and pour it into the palm of his own left hand

**16**  and dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand and sprinkle some oil with his finger seven times before the L**ORD**.

**17**  And some of the oil that remains in his hand the priest shall put on the lobe of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot, on top of the blood of the guilt offering.

**18**  And the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall put on the head of him who is to be cleansed. [†](#Lv_CR350) Then the priest shall make atonement for him before the L**ORD**.

**19**  The priest shall offer the sin offering, to make atonement for him who is to be cleansed from his uncleanness. And afterward he shall kill the burnt offering.

**20**  And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the [†](#Lv_CR351) grain offering on the altar. [†](#Lv_CR352) Thus the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean.

**21**  “But [†](#Lv_CR353) if he is poor and cannot afford so much, then he shall take one male lamb for a guilt offering [†](#Lv_CR354) to be waved, to make atonement for him, and a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, and a log of oil;

**22**  [†](#Lv_CR355) also two turtledoves or two pigeons, whichever he can afford. The one shall be a sin offering and the other a burnt offering.

**23**  [†](#Lv_CR356) And on the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing to the priest, to the entrance of the tent of meeting, before the L**ORD**.

**24**  [†](#Lv_CR357) And the priest shall take the lamb of the guilt offering and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the L**ORD**.

**25**  And he shall kill the lamb of the guilt offering. [†](#Lv_CR358) And the priest shall take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the lobe of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.

**26**  And the priest shall pour some of the oil into the palm of his own left hand,

**27**  and shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the L**ORD**.

**28**  And the priest shall put some of the oil that is in his hand on the lobe of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot, in the place where the blood of the guilt offering was put.

**29**  And the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall put on the head of him who is to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before the L**ORD**.

**30**  And he shall offer, of the [†](#Lv_CR359) turtledoves or pigeons, whichever he can afford,

**31**  one [*](#Lv_NC29) for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, along with a grain offering. [†](#Lv_CR360) And the priest shall make atonement before the L**ORD** for him who is being cleansed.

**32**  This is the law for him in whom is a case of leprous disease, who cannot afford [†](#Lv_CR361) the offerings for his cleansing.”

**33**  The L**ORD** spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,

**34** [✞] “When you come into the land of Canaan, which I give you [†](#Lv_CR362) for a possession, and I put a case of leprous disease in a house in the land of your possession,

**35**  then he who owns the house shall come and tell the priest, ‘There seems to me to be some case of [†](#Lv_CR363) disease in my house.’

**36**  Then the priest shall command that they empty the house before the priest goes to examine the disease, lest all that is in the house be declared unclean. And afterward the priest shall go in to see the house.

**37**  And he shall examine the disease. And if the disease is in the walls of the house with greenish or reddish spots, and if it appears to be deeper than the surface,

**38**  then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house and shut up the house seven days.

**39**  And the priest shall come again on the seventh day, and look. If the disease has spread in the walls of the house,

**40**  then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which is the disease and throw them into an unclean place outside the city.

**41**  And he shall have the inside of the house scraped all around, and the plaster that they scrape off they shall pour out in an unclean place outside the city.

**42**  Then they shall take other stones and put them in the place of those stones, and he shall take other plaster and plaster the house.

**43**  “If the disease breaks out again in the house, after he has taken out the stones and scraped the house and plastered it,

**44**  then the priest shall go and look. And if the disease has spread in the house, it is a [†](#Lv_CR364) persistent leprous disease in the house; it is unclean.

**45**  And he shall break down the house, its stones and timber and all the plaster of the house, and he shall carry them out of the city to an unclean place.

**46**  Moreover, whoever enters the house while it is shut up shall be unclean until the evening,

**47**  and whoever sleeps in the house [†](#Lv_CR365) shall wash his clothes, and whoever eats in the house shall wash his clothes.

**48**  “But if the priest comes and looks, and if the disease has not spread in the house after the house was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, for the disease is healed.

**49**  And for the [†](#Lv_CR366) cleansing of the house he shall take [†](#Lv_CR367) two small birds, with cedarwood and scarlet yarn and hyssop,

**50**  and shall kill one of the birds in an earthenware vessel over fresh water

**51**  and shall take the cedarwood and the hyssop and the scarlet yarn, along with the live bird, and dip them in the blood of the bird that was killed and in the fresh water and sprinkle the house seven times.

**52**  Thus he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird and with the fresh water and with the live bird and with the cedarwood and hyssop and scarlet yarn.

**53**  And he shall let the live bird go out of the city [†](#Lv_CR368) into the open country. So he shall [†](#Lv_CR369) make atonement for the house, and it shall be clean.”

**54**  This is the law for any case of leprous disease: for [†](#Lv_CR370) an itch,

**55**  for [†](#Lv_CR371) leprous disease in a garment or in [†](#Lv_CR372) a house,

**56**  and [†](#Lv_CR373) for a swelling or an eruption or a spot,

**57**  to [†](#Lv_CR374) show when it is unclean and when it is clean. This is the law for leprous disease.
