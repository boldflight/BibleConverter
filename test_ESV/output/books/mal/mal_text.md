## PREDESTINATION

F ew doctrines spark as much controversy or provoke as much consternation as the doctrine of predestination. It is a difficult doctrine that demands to be handled with great care and caution. Yet it is a biblical doctrine and therefore demands to be handled. We dare not ignore it.

Virtually all Christian churches have some doctrine of predestination. This is unavoidable since the concept is clearly found in Holy Scripture. Those churches however disagree, sometimes strongly, over its meaning. The Methodist view differs from the Lutheran view, which disagrees with the Presbyterian view. Though their views differ, each is trying to come to grips with this difficult matter.

What predestination means, in its most elementary form, is that our final destination, heaven or hell, is decided by God not only before we get there, but before we are even born. It teaches that our ultimate destiny is in the hands of God. Another way of saying it is this: From all eternity, before we even existed, God decided to save some members of the human race and to let the rest of the human race perish. God made a choice—He chose some individuals to be saved into everlasting blessedness in heaven and others He chose to pass over, to allow them to follow the consequences of their sins into eternal torment in hell.

Accepting this definition is common to many churches. To get to the heart of the matter one must ask, how does God choose? The non-Reformed view, held by the vast majority of Christians, is that God makes that choice on the basis of His foreknowledge. God chooses for eternal life those whom He knows will choose Him. This is called the _prescient_ view of predestination because it rests on God’s foreknowledge of human decisions or acts.

The Reformed view differs in that it sees the ultimate decision for salvation resting with God and not with us. In this view, God’s election is sovereign. It does not rest upon the foreseen decisions or responses of human beings. Indeed, it sees those decisions as flowing from the sovereign grace of God.

The Reformed view holds that, left to himself, no fallen person would ever choose God. Fallen people still have a free will and are able to choose what they desire. But the problem is that we have no desire for God and will not choose Christ unless first regenerated. Faith is a gift that comes out of rebirth. Only those who are elect will ever respond to the gospel in faith.

The elect do choose Christ, but only because they were first chosen by God. As in the case of Jacob and Esau, the elect are chosen solely on the basis of the sovereign good pleasure of God and not on the basis of anything they have done or will do. Paul declares:

And not only so, but also when Rebekah had conceived children by one man, our forefather Isaac, though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad—in order that God’s purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of him who calls—she was told, “The older will serve the younger.” . . . So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy (Rom. 9:10–12, 16).

A vexing problem with predestination is that God does not choose or elect to save everybody. He reserves the right to have mercy upon whom He will have mercy. Some of fallen humanity receive the grace and mercy of election. The rest God passes over, leaving them in their sin. The nonelect receive justice. The elect receive mercy. No one receives injustice. God is not obligated to be merciful to any or to all alike. It is His decision how merciful He chooses to be. Yet He is never guilty of being unrighteous toward anyone (see Rom. 9:14-15).

## MARRIAGE

T he institution of marriage was ordained and instituted by God at Creation. Christ sanctified it by His presence at the wedding feast of Cana and by His instructions via His apostles in the New Testament. Most modern wedding ceremonies reflect this and acknowledge the divine origin of marriage. What is often ignored or overlooked in modern contracts is that marriage is regulated by God’s commandments. God’s law circumscribes the meaning and legitimacy of marriage.

Marriage is to be an exclusive relationship between one man and one woman wherein the two become “one flesh,” being unified physically, emotionally, intellectually, and spiritually. It is intended to last for life. The union is secured by a sacred vow and covenant and consummated by physical union. Scripture lists only two situations under which the agreement may be dissolved—infidelity and abandonment.

Infidelity is forbidden in the marriage relationship. The institution of marriage was created by God so that men and women could mutually complete one another and take part in His creative work of procreation. The physical union necessary for procreation also has a spiritual significance. It points toward and illustrates the spiritual union of husband and wife. Paul uses this union to symbolize the relationship between Christ and His church even as the Old Testament described the covenant relationship between God and Israel by the figure of marriage. Fidelity, mutual cherishing, and support are to be at the core of the marriage relationship. Acts of infidelity break the covenant and, as such, allow the injured party to sue for divorce.

In addition, Paul in 1 Cor. 7:12-16, says that if a believing spouse is abandoned, he or she is under no obligation to maintain the marriage covenant. Abandonment, like infidelity, is a fundamental violation of God’s design for marriage.

Marriage is a creation ordinance. One need not be a Christian in order to receive the common grace of the institution. While all men and women may marry, the Christian is called to marry only “in the Lord.” Scripture is clear in its prohibition against Christians marrying non-Christians.

In the order of marriage, the husband is called to be the “head” of the wife. The wife is called to be in submission to her husband as to the Lord. The husband is called to love his wife and to give himself sacrificially to his wife as Christ loved His bride, the church, and gave Himself for it.

### The Lord’s Love for Israel

1 [✞] The oracle of the word of the L**ORD** to Israel by Malachi. [*](#Mal_NC1)

**2** [✞] [†](#Maltext_EFN1) “I have loved you,” says the L**ORD**. [†](#Maltext_EFN2) But you say, “How have you loved us?” “Is not Esau [†](#Maltext_EFN3) Jacob’s brother?” declares the L**ORD**. “Yet [†](#Maltext_EFN4) I have loved Jacob

**3** [✞] but Esau I have hated. [†](#Maltext_EFN5) I have laid waste his hill country and left his heritage to jackals of the desert.”

**4**  If Edom says, “We are shattered but we will rebuild the ruins,” the L**ORD** of hosts says, “They may build, but I will tear down, and they will be called ‘the wicked country,’ and ‘the people with whom the L**ORD** is angry forever.’”

**5** [✞] [†](#Maltext_EFN6) Your own eyes shall see this, and you shall say, “Great is the L**ORD** beyond the border of Israel!”

**6** [✞] [†](#Maltext_EFN7) “A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If then I am [†](#Maltext_EFN8) a father, where is my honor? And if I am [†](#Maltext_EFN9) a master, where is my fear? says the L**ORD** of hosts to you, O priests, who despise my name. [†](#Maltext_EFN10) But you say, ‘How have we despised your name?’

**7** [✞] [†](#Maltext_EFN11) By offering polluted food upon my altar. [†](#Maltext_EFN12) But you say, ‘How have we polluted you?’ By saying that [†](#Maltext_EFN13) the L**ORD**’s table may be despised.

**8** [✞] [†](#Maltext_EFN14) When you offer blind animals in sacrifice, is that not evil? And when you offer those that are lame or sick, is that not evil? Present that to your governor; will he accept you or show you favor? says the L**ORD** of hosts.

**9**  And now [†](#Maltext_EFN15) entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us. With such a gift from your hand, [†](#Maltext_EFN16) will he show favor to any of you? says the L**ORD** of hosts.

**10** [✞] [†](#Maltext_EFN17) Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors, that you might not kindle fire on my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, says the L**ORD** of hosts, [†](#Maltext_EFN18) and I will not accept an offering from your hand.

**11** [✞] For from the rising of the sun to its setting my name [†](#Maltext_EFN19) will be [*](#Mal_NC2) great among the nations, and in every place incense will be offered to my name, and a pure offering. For my name [†](#Maltext_EFN19) will be great among the nations, says the L**ORD** of hosts.

**12** [✞] But you profane it when you say that [†](#Maltext_EFN20) the Lord’s table is polluted, and its fruit, that is, its food may be despised.

**13**  But you say, [†](#Maltext_EFN21) ‘What a weariness this is,’ and you snort at it, says the L**ORD** of hosts. [†](#Maltext_EFN22) You bring what has been taken by violence or is lame or sick, and this you bring as your offering! Shall I accept that from your hand? says the L**ORD**.

**14** [✞] Cursed be the cheat who has [†](#Maltext_EFN23) a male in his flock, and [†](#Maltext_EFN24) vows it, and yet sacrifices to the Lord what is blemished. For [†](#Maltext_EFN25) I am a great King, says the L**ORD** of hosts, and my name [†](#Maltext_EFN26) will be feared among the nations.2 [✞] “And now, [†](#Maltext_EFN27) O priests, [†](#Maltext_EFN28) this command is for you.

**2** [✞] [†](#Maltext_EFN29) If you will not listen, if you will not take it to heart to give honor to my name, says the L**ORD** of hosts, then I will send [†](#Maltext_EFN30) the curse upon you and I will curse [†](#Maltext_EFN31) your blessings. Indeed, I have already cursed them, because you do not lay it to heart.

**3** [✞] Behold, [†](#Maltext_EFN32) I will rebuke your offspring, [*](#Mal_NC3) and [†](#Maltext_EFN33) spread dung on your faces, the [†](#Maltext_EFN34) dung of your offerings, and you shall be taken away with it. [*](#Mal_NC4)

**4** [✞] So shall you know that I have sent [†](#Maltext_EFN35) this command to you, that [†](#Maltext_EFN36) my covenant with Levi may stand, says the L**ORD** of hosts.

**5** [✞] My covenant with him was one of life and [†](#Maltext_EFN37) peace, and I gave them to him. [†](#Maltext_EFN38) It was a covenant of fear, and he feared me. He stood in awe of my name.

**6**  [†](#Maltext_EFN39) True instruction [*](#Mal_NC5) was in his mouth, and no wrong was found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and he [†](#Maltext_EFN40) turned many from iniquity.

**7** [✞] For [†](#Maltext_EFN41) the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and people [*](#Mal_NC6) should seek instruction from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the L**ORD** of hosts.

**8** [✞] But you have turned aside from the way. [†](#Maltext_EFN42) You have caused many to stumble by your instruction. You have corrupted [†](#Maltext_EFN43) the covenant of Levi, says the L**ORD** of hosts,

**9** [✞] and so [†](#Maltext_EFN44) I make you despised and abased before all the people, inasmuch as you do not keep my ways but [†](#Maltext_EFN45) show partiality in your instruction.”

**10** [✞] Have we not all [†](#Maltext_EFN46) one Father? Has not [†](#Maltext_EFN47) one God created us? Why then are we [†](#Maltext_EFN48) faithless to one another, profaning the covenant of our fathers?

**11** [✞] Judah has been [†](#Maltext_EFN49) faithless, and abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem. For [†](#Maltext_EFN50) Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the L**ORD**, which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.

**12**  May the L**ORD** cut off from the tents of Jacob any descendant [*](#Mal_NC7) of the man who does this, who [†](#Maltext_EFN51) brings an offering to the L**ORD** of hosts!

**13** [✞] And this second thing you do. [†](#Maltext_EFN52) You cover the L**ORD**’s altar with tears, with weeping and groaning because he no longer regards the offering or accepts it with favor from your hand.

**14** [✞] [†](#Maltext_EFN53) But you say, “Why does he not?” Because the L**ORD** [†](#Maltext_EFN54) was witness between you and the wife of your youth, [†](#Maltext_EFN55) to whom [†](#Maltext_EFN56) you have been faithless, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant.

**15** [✞] [†](#Maltext_EFN57) Did he not make them one, with a portion of the Spirit in their union? [*](#Mal_NC8) And what was the one God [*](#Mal_NC9) seeking? [*](#Mal_NC10) [†](#Maltext_EFN58) Godly offspring. So guard yourselves [*](#Mal_NC11) in your spirit, and let none of you be [†](#Maltext_EFN59) faithless to the wife of your youth.

**16** [✞] “For [†](#Maltext_EFN60) the man who does not love his wife but divorces her, [*](#Mal_NC12) says the L**ORD**, the God of Israel, covers [*](#Mal_NC13) his garment with violence, says the L**ORD** of hosts. So guard yourselves in your spirit, and [†](#Maltext_EFN61) do not be faithless.”

**17** [✞] [†](#Maltext_EFN62) You have wearied the L**ORD** with your words. [†](#Maltext_EFN63) But you say, “How have we wearied him?” [†](#Maltext_EFN64) By saying, “Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the L**ORD**, and he delights in them.” Or by asking, [†](#Maltext_EFN65) “Where is the God of justice?”3 [✞] [†](#Maltext_EFN66) “Behold, I send [†](#Maltext_EFN67) my messenger, and [†](#Maltext_EFN68) he will prepare the way before me. And the Lord [†](#Maltext_EFN69) whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple; and [†](#Maltext_EFN70) the messenger of the covenant in whom you delight, behold, he is coming, says the L**ORD** of hosts.

**2** [✞] But [†](#Maltext_EFN71) who can endure the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appears? For [†](#Maltext_EFN72) he is like a refiner’s fire and like fullers’ soap.

**3** [✞] He will sit [†](#Maltext_EFN73) as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, and they will bring [†](#Maltext_EFN74) offerings in righteousness to the L**ORD**. [*](#Mal_NC14)

**4**  [†](#Maltext_EFN75) Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the L**ORD** as in the days of old and as in former years.

**5** [✞] “Then I will draw near to you for judgment. I will be [†](#Maltext_EFN76) a swift witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against those who swear falsely, against those [†](#Maltext_EFN77) who oppress the hired worker in his wages, [†](#Maltext_EFN78) the widow and the fatherless, against those who thrust aside the sojourner, and do not fear me, says the L**ORD** of hosts.

**6** [✞] “For [†](#Maltext_EFN79) I the L**ORD** do not change; [†](#Maltext_EFN80) therefore you, O children of Jacob, are not consumed.

**7** [✞] [†](#Maltext_EFN81) From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from my statutes and have not kept them. [†](#Maltext_EFN82) Return to me, and I will return to you, says the L**ORD** of hosts. [†](#Maltext_EFN83) But you say, ‘How shall we return?’

**8** [✞] Will man rob God? Yet you are robbing me. [†](#Maltext_EFN84) But you say, ‘How have we robbed you?’ [†](#Maltext_EFN85) In your tithes and contributions.

**9**  [†](#Maltext_EFN86) You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing me, the whole nation of you.

**10** [✞] [†](#Maltext_EFN87) Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. And thereby [†](#Maltext_EFN88) put me to the test, says the L**ORD** of hosts, if I will not open [†](#Maltext_EFN89) the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you a blessing until there is no more need.

**11** [✞] I will rebuke [†](#Maltext_EFN90) the devourer [*](#Mal_NC15) for you, so that it will not destroy the fruits of your soil, and your vine in the field shall not fail to bear, says the L**ORD** of hosts.

**12**  Then [†](#Maltext_EFN91) all nations will call you blessed, for you will be [†](#Maltext_EFN92) a land of delight, says the L**ORD** of hosts.

**13** [✞] [†](#Maltext_EFN93) “Your words have been hard against me, says the L**ORD**. [†](#Maltext_EFN94) But you say, ‘How have we spoken against you?’

**14** [✞] You have said, [†](#Maltext_EFN95) ‘It is vain to serve God. [†](#Maltext_EFN96) What is the profit of our keeping his charge or of walking as in mourning before the L**ORD** of hosts?

**15** [✞] And now we call [†](#Maltext_EFN97) the arrogant blessed. [†](#Maltext_EFN97) Evildoers not only prosper but [†](#Maltext_EFN98) they put God to the test and they escape.’”

**16** [✞] Then those who feared the L**ORD** [†](#Maltext_EFN99) spoke with one another. The L**ORD** paid attention and heard them, and [†](#Maltext_EFN100) a book of remembrance was written before him of those who feared the L**ORD** and esteemed his name.

**17** [✞] “They shall be mine, says the L**ORD** of hosts, [†](#Maltext_EFN101) in the day when I make up [†](#Maltext_EFN102) my treasured possession, and I will spare them as a man spares his son who serves him.

**18**  Then once more you shall [†](#Maltext_EFN103) see the distinction between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve him.4 [✞] [*](#Mal_NC16) “For behold, [†](#Maltext_EFN104) the day is coming, [†](#Maltext_EFN105) burning like an oven, when [†](#Maltext_EFN106) all the arrogant and [†](#Maltext_EFN106) all evildoers [†](#Maltext_EFN107) will be stubble. The day that is coming [†](#Maltext_EFN107) shall set them ablaze, says the L**ORD** of hosts, so that it will leave them neither root nor branch.

**2** [✞] But for you [†](#Maltext_EFN108) who fear my name, [†](#Maltext_EFN109) the sun [†](#Maltext_EFN110) of righteousness shall rise [†](#Maltext_EFN111) with healing in its wings. You shall go out [†](#Maltext_EFN112) leaping like calves from the stall.

**3** [✞] And you shall tread down the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet, [†](#Maltext_EFN113) on the day when I act, says the L**ORD** of hosts.

**4** [✞] [†](#Maltext_EFN114) “Remember [†](#Maltext_EFN115) the law of my servant Moses, the statutes and rules [*](#Mal_NC17) that I commanded him at Horeb for all Israel.

**5** [✞] [†](#Maltext_EFN116) “Behold, I will send you [†](#Maltext_EFN117) Elijah the prophet [†](#Maltext_EFN118) before the great and awesome day of the L**ORD** comes.

**6** [✞] And he will [†](#Maltext_EFN119) turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers, lest I come and [†](#Maltext_EFN120) strike the land with a decree of utter destruction.” [*](#Mal_NC18)
