### God’s Wrath Against Nineveh

1 [✞] [†](#Natext_EFN1) An oracle concerning [†](#Natext_EFN2) Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum of Elkosh.

> **2** [✞] [†](#Natext_EFN3) The L**ORD** is a jealous and avenging God;

  > the L**ORD** is avenging and wrathful;

> [†](#Natext_EFN4) the L**ORD** takes vengeance on his adversaries

  > and [†](#Natext_EFN5) keeps wrath for his enemies.

> **3** [✞] [†](#Natext_EFN6) The L**ORD** is slow to anger and [†](#Natext_EFN7) great in power,

  > and [†](#Natext_EFN8) the L**ORD** will by no means clear the guilty.

> [†](#Natext_EFN9) His way is in whirlwind and storm,

  > and the clouds are the dust of his feet.

> **4** [✞] [†](#Natext_EFN10) He rebukes the sea and makes it dry;

  > he dries up all the rivers;

> [†](#Natext_EFN11) Bashan and [†](#Natext_EFN12) Carmel wither;

  > the bloom of [†](#Natext_EFN11) Lebanon withers.

> **5** [✞] [†](#Natext_EFN13) The mountains quake before him;

  > [†](#Natext_EFN14) the hills melt;

> the earth heaves before him,

  > [†](#Natext_EFN15) the world and all who dwell in it.

> **6** [✞] [†](#Natext_EFN16) Who can stand before his indignation?

  > Who can endure the heat of his anger?

> His wrath [†](#Natext_EFN17) is poured out like fire,

  > and [†](#Natext_EFN18) the rocks are broken into pieces by him.

> **7** [✞] [†](#Natext_EFN19) The L**ORD** is good,

  > [†](#Natext_EFN20) a stronghold in the day of trouble;

> [†](#Natext_EFN21) he knows those who take refuge in him.

  > **8** [✞] But [†](#Natext_EFN22) with an overflowing flood

> he will make a complete end of the adversaries, [*](#Na_NC1)

  > and [†](#Natext_EFN23) will pursue his enemies into darkness.

> **9** [✞] What [†](#Natext_EFN24) do you plot against the L**ORD**?

  > [†](#Natext_EFN25) He will make a complete end;

  > trouble will not rise up a second time.

> **10**  For they are [†](#Natext_EFN26) like entangled thorns,

  > like drunkards as they drink;

  > [†](#Natext_EFN27) they are consumed like stubble fully dried.

> **11** [✞] From you came one

  > [†](#Natext_EFN28) who plotted evil against the L**ORD**,

  > a worthless counselor.

> **12** [✞] Thus says the L**ORD**,

> “Though they are at full strength and many,

  > [†](#Natext_EFN29) they will be cut down and pass away.

> [†](#Natext_EFN30) Though I have afflicted you,

  > I will afflict you no more.

> **13** [✞] And now [†](#Natext_EFN31) I will break his yoke from off you

  > and will burst your bonds apart.”

> **14** [✞] The L**ORD** has given commandment about you:

  > [†](#Natext_EFN32) “No more shall your name be perpetuated;

> from [†](#Natext_EFN33) the house of your gods I will cut off

  > the carved image and the metal image.

> [†](#Natext_EFN34) I will make your grave, [†](#Natext_EFN35) for you are vile.”

> **15** [✞] [*](#Na_NC2) [†](#Natext_EFN36) Behold, upon the mountains, [†](#Natext_EFN37) the feet of him

  > who brings good news,

  > who publishes peace!

> [†](#Natext_EFN38) Keep your feasts, O Judah;

  > [†](#Natext_EFN39) fulfill your vows,

> [†](#Natext_EFN40) for never again shall the worthless pass through you;

  > he is utterly cut off.

  > [†](#Natext_EFN42) Man the ramparts;

  > watch the road;

> dress for battle; [*](#Na_NC3)

  > collect all your strength.

> **2** [✞] For [†](#Natext_EFN43) the L**ORD** is restoring the majesty of Jacob

  > as the majesty of Israel,

> for plunderers have plundered them

  > and [†](#Natext_EFN44) ruined their branches.

> **3** [✞] The shield of his mighty men is red;

  > [†](#Natext_EFN45) his soldiers are clothed in scarlet.

> The chariots come with flashing metal

  > on the day he musters them;

  > the cypress spears are brandished.

> **4** [✞] [†](#Natext_EFN46) The chariots race madly through the streets;

  > they rush to and fro through the squares;

> they gleam like torches;

  > they dart like lightning.

> **5** [✞] He remembers [†](#Natext_EFN47) his officers;

  > [†](#Natext_EFN48) they stumble as they go,

> they hasten to the wall;

  > the siege tower [*](#Na_NC4) is set up.

> **6** [✞] [†](#Natext_EFN49) The river gates are opened;

  > the palace [†](#Natext_EFN50) melts away;

> **7** [✞] its mistress [*](#Na_NC5) is [†](#Natext_EFN51) stripped; [*](#Na_NC6) she is carried off,

  > her slave girls [†](#Natext_EFN52) lamenting,

> moaning like doves

  > and beating their breasts.

> **8** [✞] [†](#Natext_EFN53) Nineveh is like a pool

  > whose waters run away. [*](#Na_NC7)

> “Halt! Halt!” they cry,

  > but [†](#Natext_EFN54) none turns back.

> **9** [✞] Plunder the silver,

  > plunder the gold!

> There is no end of the treasure

  > or of the wealth of all precious things.

> **10** [✞] [†](#Natext_EFN55) Desolate! Desolation and ruin!

  > [†](#Natext_EFN56) Hearts melt and [†](#Natext_EFN57) knees tremble;

> [†](#Natext_EFN58) anguish is in all loins;

  > [†](#Natext_EFN59) all faces grow pale!

> **11** [✞] Where is the lions’ den,

  > the feeding place of [†](#Natext_EFN60) the young lions,

> where the lion and lioness went,

  > where his cubs were, with [†](#Natext_EFN61) none to disturb?

> **12**  [†](#Natext_EFN62) The lion tore enough for his cubs

  > and [†](#Natext_EFN63) strangled prey for his lionesses;

> he filled his caves with prey

  > and his dens with torn flesh.

**13** [✞] [†](#Natext_EFN64) Behold, I am against you, declares the L**ORD** of hosts, and [†](#Natext_EFN65) I will burn your [*](#Na_NC8) chariots in smoke, and the sword shall devour your young lions. I will cut off your prey from the earth, and [†](#Natext_EFN66) the voice of your messengers shall no longer be heard.

  > all full of lies and plunder—

  > [†](#Natext_EFN68) no end to the prey!

> **2** [✞] The crack of the whip, and [†](#Natext_EFN69) rumble of the wheel,

  > [†](#Natext_EFN70) galloping horse and [†](#Natext_EFN71) bounding chariot!

> **3** [✞] Horsemen charging,

  > flashing sword and [†](#Natext_EFN72) glittering spear,

> [†](#Natext_EFN73) hosts of slain,

  > heaps of corpses,

> dead bodies without end—

  > they stumble over the bodies!

> **4** [✞] And all for the countless whorings of the [†](#Natext_EFN74) prostitute,

  > [†](#Natext_EFN75) graceful and of deadly charms,

> who betrays nations with her whorings,

  > and peoples with her charms.

> **5** [✞] [†](#Natext_EFN76) Behold, I am against you,

  > declares the L**ORD** of hosts,

  > and [†](#Natext_EFN77) will lift up your skirts over your face;

> and I will make nations look at [†](#Natext_EFN78) your nakedness

  > and kingdoms at your shame.

> **6** [✞] I will throw filth at you

  > and [†](#Natext_EFN79) treat you with contempt

  > and make you [†](#Natext_EFN80) a spectacle.

> **7** [✞] And all who look at you [†](#Natext_EFN81) will shrink from you and say,

> “Wasted is [†](#Natext_EFN82) Nineveh; [†](#Natext_EFN83) who will grieve for her?”

  > [†](#Natext_EFN84) Where shall I seek comforters for you?

> **8** [✞] [†](#Natext_EFN85) Are you better than [†](#Natext_EFN86) Thebes [*](#Na_NC9)

  > that sat [†](#Natext_EFN87) by the Nile,

> with water around her,

  > her rampart a sea,

  > and water her wall?

> **9** [✞] [†](#Natext_EFN88) Cush was her strength;

  > Egypt too, and that without limit;

  > [†](#Natext_EFN89) Put and the [†](#Natext_EFN90) Libyans were her [*](#Na_NC10) helpers.

> **10** [✞] [†](#Natext_EFN91) Yet she became an exile;

  > she went into captivity;

> [†](#Natext_EFN92) her infants were dashed in pieces

  > at the head of every street;

> for her honored men [†](#Natext_EFN93) lots were cast,

  > [†](#Natext_EFN94) and all her great men were bound in chains.

> **11** [✞] [†](#Natext_EFN95) You also will be drunken;

  > you will go into hiding;

> [†](#Natext_EFN96) you will seek a refuge from the enemy.

> **12** [✞] All your fortresses are [†](#Natext_EFN97) like fig trees

  > with first-ripe figs—

> if shaken they fall

  > into the mouth of the eater.

> **13** [✞] Behold, your troops

  > [†](#Natext_EFN98) are women in your midst.

> The gates of your land

  > are wide open to your enemies;

  > fire has devoured your bars.

> **14** [✞] [†](#Natext_EFN99) Draw water for the siege;

  > [†](#Natext_EFN100) strengthen your forts;

> go into the clay;

  > tread the mortar;

  > take hold of the brick mold!

> **15** [✞] There will the fire devour you;

  > the sword will cut you off.

  > It will [†](#Natext_EFN101) devour you [†](#Natext_EFN102) like the locust.

> Multiply yourselves [†](#Natext_EFN102) like the locust;

  > multiply [†](#Natext_EFN102) like the grasshopper!

> **16** [✞] You increased [†](#Natext_EFN103) your merchants

  > more than the stars of the heavens.

  > [†](#Natext_EFN104) The locust spreads its wings and flies away.

> **17** [✞] Your [†](#Natext_EFN105) princes are [†](#Natext_EFN106) like grasshoppers,

  > [†](#Natext_EFN107) your scribes [*](#Na_NC11) like clouds of locusts

> settling on the fences

  > in a day of cold—

> when the sun rises, they fly away;

  > no one knows where they are.

> **18** [✞] Your shepherds [†](#Natext_EFN108) are asleep,

  > O king of Assyria;

  > [†](#Natext_EFN109) your nobles slumber.

> Your people [†](#Natext_EFN110) are scattered on the mountains

  > with none to gather them.

> **19** [✞] There is no easing your hurt;

  > [†](#Natext_EFN111) your wound is grievous.

> All who hear the news about you

  > [†](#Natext_EFN112) clap their hands over you.

> For [†](#Natext_EFN113) upon whom has not come

  > your unceasing evil?
