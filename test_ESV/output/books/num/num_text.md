### A Census of Israel’s Warriors

1 [✞] The L**ORD** spoke to Moses [†](#Nm_CR1) in the wilderness of Sinai, [†](#Nm_CR2) in the tent of meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,

**2**  [†](#Nm_CR3) “Take a census of all the congregation of the people of Israel, by clans, [†](#Nm_CR4) by fathers’ houses, according to the number of names, every male, head by head.

**3**  [†](#Nm_CR5) From twenty years old and upward, all in Israel who are able to go to war, you and Aaron shall list them, [†](#Nm_CR6) company by company.

**4**  And there shall be with you a man from each tribe, each man being the head of the house of his fathers.

**5** [✞] And these are the names of the men who shall assist you. From Reuben, [†](#Nm_CR7) Elizur the son of Shedeur;

**6**  from Simeon, [†](#Nm_CR8) Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai;

**7**  from Judah, [†](#Nm_CR9) Nahshon the son of Amminadab;

**8**  from Issachar, [†](#Nm_CR10) Nethanel the son of Zuar;

**9**  from Zebulun, [†](#Nm_CR11) Eliab the son of Helon;

**10**  from the sons of Joseph, from Ephraim, [†](#Nm_CR12) Elishama the son of Ammihud, and from Manasseh, [†](#Nm_CR13) Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur;

**11**  from Benjamin, [†](#Nm_CR14) Abidan the son of Gideoni;

**12**  from Dan, [†](#Nm_CR15) Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai;

**13**  from Asher, [†](#Nm_CR16) Pagiel the son of Ochran;

**14**  from Gad, Eliasaph the son of [†](#Nm_CR17) Deuel;

**15**  from Naphtali, [†](#Nm_CR18) Ahira the son of Enan.”

**16**  These were the ones [†](#Nm_CR19) chosen from the congregation, [†](#Nm_CR20) the chiefs of their ancestral tribes, the heads of the clans of Israel.

**17**  Moses and Aaron took these men [†](#Nm_CR21) who had been named,

**18**  and on the first day of the second month, they assembled the whole congregation together, who registered themselves by clans, by fathers’ houses, according to the number of names from twenty years old and upward, head by head,

**19**  as the L**ORD** commanded Moses. So he listed them in the wilderness of Sinai.

**20** [✞] The people of [†](#Nm_CR22) Reuben, Israel’s firstborn, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of names, head by head, every male from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go to war:

**21**  those listed of the tribe of Reuben were [†](#Nm_CR23) 46,500.

**22**  Of the people of Simeon, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers’ houses, those of them who were listed, according to the number of names, head by head, every male from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go to war:

**23**  those listed of the tribe of Simeon were [†](#Nm_CR24) 59,300.

**24**  Of the people of Gad, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go to war:

**28**  Of the people of Issachar, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, every man able to go to war:

**29**  those listed of the tribe of Issachar were [†](#Nm_CR27) 54,400.

**30**  Of the people of Zebulun, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, every man able to go to war:

**31**  those listed of the tribe of Zebulun were [†](#Nm_CR28) 57,400.

**32**  Of the people of Joseph, namely, of the people of Ephraim, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, every man able to go to war:

**33**  those listed of the tribe of Ephraim were [†](#Nm_CR29) 40,500.

**34**  Of the people of Manasseh, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, every man able to go to war:

**35**  those listed of the tribe of Manasseh were [†](#Nm_CR30) 32,200.

**36**  Of the people of Benjamin, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, every man able to go to war:

**37**  those listed of the tribe of Benjamin were [†](#Nm_CR31) 35,400.

**38**  Of the people of Dan, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, every man able to go to war:

**39**  those listed of the tribe of Dan were [†](#Nm_CR32) 62,700.

**40**  Of the people of Asher, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, every man able to go to war:

**41**  those listed of the tribe of Asher were [†](#Nm_CR33) 41,500.

**42**  Of the people of Naphtali, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, every man able to go to war:

**43**  those listed of the tribe of Naphtali were [†](#Nm_CR34) 53,400.

**44**  [†](#Nm_CR35) These are those who were listed, whom Moses and Aaron listed with the help of the chiefs of Israel, twelve men, each representing his fathers’ house.

**45** [✞] So all those listed of the people of Israel, by their fathers’ houses, from twenty years old and upward, every man able to go to war in Israel—

**46** [✞] all those listed were [†](#Nm_CR36) 603,550.

**47** [✞] But [†](#Nm_CR37) the Levites were not listed along with them by their ancestral tribe.

**48**  For the L**ORD** spoke to Moses, saying,

**49**  “Only the tribe of Levi you shall not list, and you shall not take a census of them among the people of Israel.

**50**  [†](#Nm_CR38) But appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all its furnishings, and over all that belongs to it. They are to carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings, and they shall take care of it [†](#Nm_CR39) and shall camp around the tabernacle.

**51**  [†](#Nm_CR40) When the tabernacle is to set out, the Levites shall take it down, and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up. [†](#Nm_CR41) And if any outsider comes near, he shall be put to death.

**52**  The people of Israel shall pitch their tents by their companies, each man in his own camp and [†](#Nm_CR42) each man by his own standard.

**53**  But the Levites shall camp around the tabernacle of the testimony, so that there may be no [†](#Nm_CR43) wrath on the congregation of the people of Israel. [†](#Nm_CR44) And the Levites shall keep guard over the tabernacle of the testimony.”

**54**  Thus did the people of Israel; they did according to all that the L**ORD** commanded Moses.2 [✞] The L**ORD** spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,

**2**  [†](#Nm_CR45) “The people of Israel shall camp each by his own standard, with the banners of their fathers’ houses. They shall camp facing the tent of meeting on every side.

**3**  Those to camp on the east side toward the sunrise shall be of the standard of the camp of Judah by their companies, the chief of the people of Judah being [†](#Nm_CR46) Nahshon the son of Amminadab,

**4**  his company as listed being 74,600.

**5**  Those to camp next to him shall be the tribe of Issachar, the chief of the people of Issachar being Nethanel the son of Zuar,

**6**  his company as listed being 54,400.

**7**  Then the tribe of Zebulun, the chief of the people of Zebulun being Eliab the son of Helon,

**8**  his company as listed being 57,400.

**9**  All those listed of the camp of Judah, by their companies, were 186,400. [†](#Nm_CR47) They shall set out first on the march.

**10**  “On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben by their companies, the chief of the people of Reuben being Elizur the son of Shedeur,

**11**  his company as listed being 46,500.

**12**  And those to camp next to him shall be the tribe of Simeon, the chief of the people of Simeon being Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai,

**13**  his company as listed being 59,300.

**14** [✞] Then the tribe of Gad, the chief of the people of Gad being Eliasaph the son of [†](#Nm_CR48) Reuel,

**15**  his company as listed being 45,650.

**16**  All those listed of the camp of Reuben, by their companies, were 151,450. [†](#Nm_CR49) They shall set out second.

**17**  [†](#Nm_CR50) “Then the tent of meeting shall set out, with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camps; as they camp, so shall they set out, each in position, standard by standard.

**18**  “On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim by their companies, the chief of the people of Ephraim being Elishama the son of Ammihud,

**19**  his company as listed being 40,500.

**20**  And next to him shall be the tribe of Manasseh, the chief of the people of Manasseh being Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur,

**21**  his company as listed being 32,200.

**22**  Then the tribe of Benjamin, the chief of the people of Benjamin being Abidan the son of Gideoni,

**23**  his company as listed being 35,400.

**24**  All those listed of the camp of Ephraim, by their companies, were 108,100. [†](#Nm_CR51) They shall set out third on the march.

**25**  “On the north side shall be the standard of the camp of Dan by their companies, the chief of the people of Dan being Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai,

**26**  his company as listed being 62,700.

**27**  And those to camp next to him shall be the tribe of Asher, the chief of the people of Asher being Pagiel the son of Ochran,

**28**  his company as listed being 41,500.

**29**  Then the tribe of Naphtali, the chief of the people of Naphtali being Ahira the son of Enan,

**30**  his company as listed being 53,400.

**31**  All those listed of the camp of Dan were 157,600. [†](#Nm_CR52) They shall set out last, standard by standard.”

**32**  These are the people of Israel as listed by their fathers’ houses. All those listed in the camps by their companies were [†](#Nm_CR53) 603,550.

**33**  But [†](#Nm_CR54) the Levites were not listed among the people of Israel, as the L**ORD** commanded Moses.

**34**  Thus did the people of Israel. According to all that the L**ORD** commanded Moses, [†](#Nm_CR55) so they camped by their standards, and so they set out, each one in his clan, according to his fathers’ house.3 [✞] These are the generations of Aaron and Moses at the time when the L**ORD** spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai.

**2**  These are the names of the sons of Aaron: [†](#Nm_CR56) Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

**3** [✞] These are the names of the sons of Aaron, [†](#Nm_CR57) the anointed priests, [†](#Nm_CR58) whom he ordained to serve as priests.

**4** [✞] [†](#Nm_CR59) But Nadab and Abihu died before the L**ORD** when they offered unauthorized fire before the L**ORD** in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children. So Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests in the lifetime of Aaron their father.

**5**  And the L**ORD** spoke to Moses, saying,

**6**  [†](#Nm_CR60) “Bring the tribe of Levi near, and set them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister to him.

**7**  They shall keep guard over him and over the whole congregation before the tent of meeting, [†](#Nm_CR61) as they minister at the tabernacle.

**8**  They shall guard all the furnishings of the tent of meeting, and keep guard over the people of Israel as they minister at the tabernacle.

**9**  And [†](#Nm_CR62) you shall give the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they are [†](#Nm_CR63) wholly given to him from among the people of Israel.

**10**  And you shall appoint Aaron and his sons, and [†](#Nm_CR64) they shall guard their priesthood. But if [†](#Nm_CR65) any outsider comes near, he shall be put to death.”

**11** [✞] And the L**ORD** spoke to Moses, saying,

**12**  “Behold, [†](#Nm_CR66) I have taken the Levites from among the people of Israel instead of every firstborn who opens the womb among the people of Israel. The Levites shall be mine,

**13**  for [†](#Nm_CR67) all the firstborn are mine. [†](#Nm_CR68) On the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I consecrated for my own all the firstborn in Israel, both of man and of beast. They shall be mine: I am the L**ORD**.”

**14** [✞] And the L**ORD** spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,

**15**  “List the sons of Levi, by fathers’ houses and by clans; [†](#Nm_CR69) every male from a month old and upward you shall list.”

**16**  So Moses listed them according to the word of the L**ORD**, as he was commanded.

**17**  [†](#Nm_CR70) And these were the sons of Levi by their names: Gershon and Kohath and Merari.

**18**  And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their clans: [†](#Nm_CR71) Libni and Shimei.

**19**  And the sons of Kohath by their clans: [†](#Nm_CR72) Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.

**20**  And the sons of Merari by their clans: [†](#Nm_CR73) Mahli and Mushi. These are the clans of the Levites, by their fathers’ houses.

**21**  To Gershon belonged the clan of the Libnites and the clan of the Shimeites; these were the clans of the Gershonites.

**22**  Their listing according to the number of all the males from a month old and upward was [*](#Nm_NB1) 7,500.

**23**  [†](#Nm_CR74) The clans of the Gershonites were to camp behind the tabernacle on the west,

**24**  with Eliasaph, the son of Lael as chief of the fathers’ house of the Gershonites.

**25**  And the [†](#Nm_CR75) guard duty of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting involved [†](#Nm_CR76) the tabernacle, [†](#Nm_CR77) the tent with [†](#Nm_CR78) its covering, [†](#Nm_CR79) the screen for the entrance of the tent of meeting,

**26**  [†](#Nm_CR80) the hangings of the court, [†](#Nm_CR81) the screen for the door of the court that is around the tabernacle and the altar, and [†](#Nm_CR82) its cords—all the service connected with these.

**27**  To Kohath belonged the clan of the [†](#Nm_CR83) Amramites and the clan of the Izharites and the clan of the Hebronites and the clan of the Uzzielites; these are the clans of the Kohathites.

**28**  According to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, there were 8,600, keeping guard over the sanctuary.

**29**  The clans of the sons of Kohath were to camp on the south side of the tabernacle,

**30**  with [†](#Nm_CR84) Elizaphan the son of Uzziel as chief of the fathers’ house of the clans of the Kohathites.

**31**  And their guard duty involved [†](#Nm_CR85) the ark, [†](#Nm_CR86) the table, [†](#Nm_CR87) the lampstand, [†](#Nm_CR88) the altars, the vessels of the sanctuary with which the priests minister, and [†](#Nm_CR89) the screen; all the service connected with these.

**32**  And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest was to be chief over the chiefs of the Levites, and to have oversight of those who kept guard over the sanctuary.

**33**  To Merari belonged the clan of the Mahlites and the clan of the Mushites: these are the clans of Merari.

**34**  Their listing according to the number of all the males from a month old and upward was 6,200.

**35**  And the chief of the fathers’ house of the clans of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail. They were to camp on the north side of the tabernacle.

**36**  [†](#Nm_CR90) And the appointed guard duty of the sons of Merari involved the [†](#Nm_CR91) frames of the tabernacle, [†](#Nm_CR92) the bars, [†](#Nm_CR93) the pillars, the bases, and all their accessories; all the service connected with these;

**37**  also [†](#Nm_CR94) the pillars around the court, with their bases and [†](#Nm_CR95) pegs and [†](#Nm_CR96) cords.

**38** [✞] Those who were to camp before the tabernacle on the east, before the tent of meeting toward the sunrise, were Moses and Aaron and his sons, [†](#Nm_CR97) guarding the sanctuary itself, to protect [*](#Nm_NB2) the people of Israel. And any outsider who came near was to be put to death.

**39** [✞] All those listed among the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron listed at the commandment of the L**ORD**, by clans, all the males from a month old and upward, were [†](#Nm_CR98) 22,000.

**40**  And the L**ORD** said to Moses, “List all the firstborn males of the people of Israel, from a month old and upward, taking the number of their names.

**41**  [†](#Nm_CR99) And you shall take the Levites for me—I am the L**ORD**—instead of all the firstborn among the people of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the cattle of the people of Israel.”

**42**  So Moses listed all the firstborn among the people of Israel, as the L**ORD** commanded him.

**43**  And all the firstborn males, according to the number of names, from a month old and upward as listed were 22,273.

**44**  And the L**ORD** spoke to Moses, saying,

**45**  [†](#Nm_CR100) “Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the people of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle. The Levites shall be mine: I am the L**ORD**.

**46**  And [†](#Nm_CR101) as the redemption price for the 273 of the firstborn of the people of Israel, over and above the number of the male Levites,

**47**  you shall take [†](#Nm_CR102) five shekels [*](#Nm_NB3) per head; you shall take them according to [†](#Nm_CR103) the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel of twenty gerahs [*](#Nm_NB4)),

**48**  and give the money to Aaron and his sons as the redemption price for those who are over.”

**49**  So Moses took the redemption money from those who were over and above those redeemed by the Levites.

**50**  From the firstborn of the people of Israel he took the money, [†](#Nm_CR104) 1,365 shekels, by the shekel of the sanctuary.

**51**  And Moses [†](#Nm_CR105) gave the redemption money to Aaron and his sons, according to the word of the L**ORD**, as the L**ORD** commanded Moses.4 [✞] The L**ORD** spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,

**2**  “Take a census of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, by their clans and their fathers’ houses,

**3**  [†](#Nm_CR106) from thirty years old up to fifty years old, all who can come on duty, to do the work in the tent of meeting.

**4**  This is the service of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting: [†](#Nm_CR107) the most holy things.

**5**  When the camp is to set out, Aaron and his sons shall go in and take down [†](#Nm_CR108) the veil of the screen and cover [†](#Nm_CR109) the ark of the testimony with it.

**6**  Then they shall put on it a covering of goatskin [*](#Nm_NB5) and spread on top of that a cloth all of blue, and shall put in its [†](#Nm_CR110) poles.

**7**  And over the [†](#Nm_CR111) table of the bread of the Presence they shall spread a cloth of blue and put on it the plates, the dishes for incense, the bowls, and the flagons for the drink offering; [†](#Nm_CR112) the regular showbread also shall be on it.

**8**  Then they shall spread over them a cloth of scarlet and cover the same with a covering of goatskin, and shall [†](#Nm_CR113) put in its poles.

**9**  And they shall take a cloth of blue and cover [†](#Nm_CR114) the lampstand for the light, with its lamps, its tongs, its trays, and all the vessels for oil with which it is supplied.

**10**  And they shall put it with all its utensils in a covering of goatskin and put it on the carrying frame.

**11**  And over [†](#Nm_CR115) the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue and cover it with a covering of goatskin, and shall put in its poles.

**12**  And they shall take all [†](#Nm_CR116) the vessels of the service that are used in the sanctuary and put them in a cloth of blue and cover them with a covering of goatskin and put them on the carrying frame.

**13**  And they shall take away the ashes from the altar and spread a purple cloth over it.

**14**  And they shall put on it all the utensils of the altar, which are used for the service there, the fire pans, the forks, the shovels, and the basins, all the utensils of the altar; and they shall spread on it a covering of goatskin, and shall put in its poles.

**15**  And when Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary and all the furnishings of the sanctuary, as the camp sets out, after that [†](#Nm_CR117) the sons of Kohath shall come to carry these, [†](#Nm_CR118) but they must not touch the holy things, lest they die. These are the things of the tent of meeting that the sons of Kohath are to carry.

**16**  “And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall have charge of [†](#Nm_CR119) the oil for the light, the [†](#Nm_CR120) fragrant incense, [†](#Nm_CR121) the regular grain offering, and [†](#Nm_CR122) the anointing oil, with the oversight of the whole tabernacle and all that is in it, of the sanctuary and its vessels.”

**17**  The L**ORD** spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,

**18**  “Let not the tribe of the clans of the Kohathites be destroyed from among the Levites,

**19**  but deal thus with them, that they may live and not die when they come near to [†](#Nm_CR123) the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in and appoint them each to his task and to his burden,

**20**  [†](#Nm_CR124) but they shall not go in to look on the holy things even for a moment, lest they die.”

**21**  The L**ORD** spoke to Moses, saying,

**22**  “Take a census of the sons of Gershon also, by their fathers’ houses and by their clans.

**23**  [†](#Nm_CR125) From thirty years old up to fifty years old, you shall list them, all who can [†](#Nm_CR126) come to do duty, to do service in the tent of meeting.

**24**  This is the service of the clans of the Gershonites, in serving and bearing burdens:

**25**  [†](#Nm_CR127) they shall carry [†](#Nm_CR128) the curtains of the tabernacle and the tent of meeting with [†](#Nm_CR129) its covering and the covering of goatskin that is on top of it and the screen for the entrance of the tent of meeting

**26**  and the hangings of the court and the screen for the entrance of the gate of the court that is around the tabernacle and the altar, and their cords and all the equipment for their service. And they shall do all that needs to be done with regard to them.

**27**  All the service of the sons of the Gershonites shall be at the command of Aaron and his sons, in all that they are to carry and in all that they have to do. And you shall assign to their charge all that they are to carry.

**28**  This is the service of the clans of the sons of the Gershonites in the tent of meeting, and their guard duty is to be [†](#Nm_CR130) under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

**29**  “As for the sons of Merari, you shall list them by their clans and their fathers’ houses.

**30**  [†](#Nm_CR131) From thirty years old up to fifty years old, you shall list them, everyone who can come on duty, to do the service of the tent of meeting.

**31**  And [†](#Nm_CR132) this is what they are charged to carry, as the whole of their service in the tent of meeting: the frames of the tabernacle, with its bars, pillars, and bases,

**32**  and the pillars around the court with their bases, pegs, and cords, with all their equipment and all their accessories. And you shall [†](#Nm_CR133) list by name the objects that they are required to carry.

**33**  This is the service of the clans of the sons of Merari, the whole of their service in the tent of meeting, [†](#Nm_CR134) under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.”

**34**  And Moses and Aaron and the chiefs of the congregation listed the sons of the Kohathites, by their clans and their fathers’ houses,

**35**  [†](#Nm_CR135) from thirty years old up to fifty years old, everyone who could come on duty, for service in the tent of meeting;

**36**  and those listed by clans were 2,750.

**37**  [†](#Nm_CR136) This was the list of the clans of the Kohathites, all who served in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron listed according to the commandment of the L**ORD** by Moses.

**38**  Those listed of the sons of Gershon, by their clans and their fathers’ houses,

**39**  [†](#Nm_CR137) from thirty years old up to fifty years old, everyone who could come on duty for service in the tent of meeting—

**40**  those listed by their clans and their fathers’ houses were 2,630.

**41**  [†](#Nm_CR138) This was the list of the clans of the sons of Gershon, all who served in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron listed according to the commandment of the L**ORD**.

**42**  Those listed of the clans of the sons of Merari, by their clans and their fathers’ houses,

**43**  [†](#Nm_CR139) from thirty years old up to fifty years old, everyone who could come on duty, for service in the tent of meeting—

**44**  those listed by clans were 3,200.

**45**  [†](#Nm_CR140) This was the list of the clans of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron listed according to the commandment of the L**ORD** by Moses.

**46**  All those who were listed of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron and the chiefs of Israel listed, by their clans and their fathers’ houses,

**47**  [†](#Nm_CR141) from thirty years old up to fifty years old, everyone who could come to do the service of ministry and the service of bearing burdens in the tent of meeting,

**48**  those listed were 8,580.

**49**  According to the commandment of the L**ORD** through Moses they were listed, [†](#Nm_CR142) each one with his task of serving or carrying. Thus they were listed by him, [†](#Nm_CR143) as the L**ORD** commanded Moses.5 [✞] The L**ORD** spoke to Moses, saying,

**2**  “Command the people of Israel that they [†](#Nm_CR144) put out of the camp everyone who is leprous [*](#Nm_NB6) or has [†](#Nm_CR145) a discharge and everyone who is [†](#Nm_CR146) unclean through contact with the dead.

**3**  You shall put out both male and female, putting them outside the camp, that they may not defile their camp, [†](#Nm_CR147) in the midst of which I dwell.”

**4**  And the people of Israel did so, and put them outside the camp; as the L**ORD** said to Moses, so the people of Israel did.

**5** [✞] And the L**ORD** spoke to Moses, saying,

**6**  “Speak to the people of Israel, [†](#Nm_CR148) When a man or woman commits any of the sins that people commit by breaking faith with the L**ORD**, and that person realizes his guilt,

**7**  [†](#Nm_CR149) he shall confess his sin that he has committed. [*](#Nm_NB7) [†](#Nm_CR150) And he shall make full restitution for his wrong, adding a fifth to it and giving it to him to whom he did the wrong.

**8**  But if the man has no next of kin to whom restitution may be made for the wrong, the restitution for wrong shall go to the L**ORD** for the priest, in addition to [†](#Nm_CR151) the ram of atonement with which atonement is made for him.

**9**  And [†](#Nm_CR152) every contribution, all the holy donations of the people of Israel, which they bring to the priest, shall be his.

**10**  Each one shall keep his holy donations: whatever anyone gives to the priest shall be his.”

**11** [✞] And the L**ORD** spoke to Moses, saying,

**12**  “Speak to the people of Israel, If any man’s wife goes astray and breaks faith with him,

**13**  if a man [†](#Nm_CR153) lies with her sexually, and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband, and she is undetected though she has defiled herself, and there is no witness against her, [†](#Nm_CR154) since she was not taken in the act,

**14**  and if the spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife who has defiled herself, or if the spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife, though she has not defiled herself,

**15**  then the man shall bring his wife to the priest and bring the offering required of her, a tenth of an ephah [*](#Nm_NB8) of barley flour. [†](#Nm_CR155) He shall pour no oil on it and put no frankincense on it, for it is a grain offering of jealousy, a grain offering of remembrance, [†](#Nm_CR156) bringing iniquity to remembrance.

**16**  “And the priest shall bring her near and set her before the L**ORD**.

**17**  And the priest shall take holy water in an earthenware vessel and take some of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle and put it into the water.

**18**  And the priest shall set the woman before the L**ORD** and [†](#Nm_CR157) unbind the hair of the woman’s head and place in her hands the grain offering of remembrance, which is the grain offering of jealousy. And in his hand the priest shall have the water of bitterness that brings the curse.

**19**  Then the priest shall make her take an oath, saying, ‘If no man has lain with you, and if you have not turned aside to uncleanness while you were under your husband’s authority, be free from this water of bitterness that brings the curse.

**20**  But if you have gone astray, though you are under your husband’s authority, and if you have defiled yourself, and some man other than your husband has lain with you,

**21**  then’ (let the priest make the woman take the oath of the curse, and say to the woman) [†](#Nm_CR158) ‘the L**ORD** make you a curse and an oath among your people, when the L**ORD** makes your thigh fall away and your body swell.

**22**  May this water that brings the curse [†](#Nm_CR159) pass into your bowels and make your womb swell and your thigh fall away.’ And the woman shall say, [†](#Nm_CR160) ‘Amen, Amen.’

**23**  “Then the priest shall write these curses in a book and wash them off into the water of bitterness.

**24**  And he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that brings the curse, and the water that brings the curse shall enter into her and cause bitter pain.

**25**  And the priest shall take the grain offering of jealousy out of the woman’s hand [†](#Nm_CR161) and shall wave the grain offering before the L**ORD** and bring it to the altar.

**26**  And the priest [†](#Nm_CR162) shall take a handful of the grain offering, as its memorial portion, and burn it on the altar, and afterward shall make the woman drink the water.

**27**  And when he has made her drink the water, then, if she has defiled herself and has broken faith with her husband, the water that brings the curse shall enter into her and cause bitter pain, and her womb shall swell, and her thigh shall fall away, and the woman [†](#Nm_CR163) shall become a curse among her people.

**28**  But if the woman has not defiled herself and is clean, then she shall be free and shall conceive children.

**29**  “This is the law in cases of jealousy, when a wife, [†](#Nm_CR164) though under her husband’s authority, goes astray and defiles herself,

**30**  or when the spirit of jealousy comes over a man and he is jealous of his wife. Then he shall set the woman before the L**ORD**, and the priest shall carry out for her all this law.

**31**  The man shall be free from iniquity, but the woman [†](#Nm_CR165) shall bear her iniquity.”6 [✞] And the L**ORD** spoke to Moses, saying,

**2**  “Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, When either a man or a woman makes a special vow, the vow of [†](#Nm_CR166) a Nazirite, [*](#Nm_NB9) [†](#Nm_CR167) to separate himself to the L**ORD**,

**3**  he [†](#Nm_CR168) shall separate himself from wine and strong drink. He shall drink no vinegar made from wine or strong drink and shall not drink any juice of grapes or eat grapes, fresh or dried.

**4**  All the days of his separation [*](#Nm_NB10) he shall eat nothing that is produced by the grapevine, not even the seeds or the skins.

**5**  “All the days of his vow of separation, no [†](#Nm_CR169) razor shall touch his head. Until the time is completed for which he separates himself to the L**ORD**, he shall be holy. [†](#Nm_CR170) He shall let the locks of hair of his head grow long.

**6**  “All the days that he separates himself to the L**ORD** [†](#Nm_CR171) he shall not go near a dead body.

**7**  [†](#Nm_CR172) Not even for his father or for his mother, for brother or sister, if they die, shall he make himself unclean, because his separation to God is on his head.

**8**  All the days of his separation he is holy to the L**ORD**.

**9**  “And if any man dies very suddenly beside him and he defiles his consecrated head, then [†](#Nm_CR173) he shall shave his head on the day of his cleansing; on the seventh day he shall shave it.

**10**  [†](#Nm_CR174) On the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two pigeons to the priest to the entrance of the tent of meeting,

**11**  and the priest shall offer one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, and make atonement for him, because he sinned by reason of the dead body. And he shall consecrate his head that same day

**12**  and separate himself to the L**ORD** for the days of his separation and bring a male lamb a year old [†](#Nm_CR175) for a guilt offering. But the previous period shall be void, because his separation was defiled.

**13**  “And this is the law for the Nazirite, [†](#Nm_CR176) when the time of his separation has been completed: he shall be brought to the entrance of the tent of meeting,

**14**  and he shall bring his gift to the L**ORD**, one male lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish [†](#Nm_CR177) as a sin offering, and one ram without blemish [†](#Nm_CR178) as a peace offering,

**15**  and a basket of unleavened bread, [†](#Nm_CR179) loaves of fine flour mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers smeared with oil, and their [†](#Nm_CR180) grain offering and their [†](#Nm_CR181) drink offerings.

**16**  And the priest shall bring them before the L**ORD** and offer [†](#Nm_CR182) his sin offering and his burnt offering,

**17**  and he shall offer the ram as a sacrifice of peace offering to the L**ORD**, with the basket of unleavened bread. The priest shall offer also its grain offering and its drink offering.

**18**  And the Nazirite [†](#Nm_CR183) shall shave his consecrated head at the entrance of the tent of meeting and shall take the hair from his consecrated head and put it on the fire that is under the sacrifice of the peace offering.

**19**  And the priest shall take the [†](#Nm_CR184) shoulder of the ram, when it is boiled, and one unleavened loaf out of the basket and one unleavened wafer, and [†](#Nm_CR185) shall put them on the hands of the Nazirite, after he has shaved the hair of his consecration,

**20**  and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the L**ORD**. [†](#Nm_CR186) They are a holy portion for the priest, together with the breast that is waved and the thigh that is contributed. And after that the Nazirite may drink wine.

**21**  “This is the law of the Nazirite. But if he vows an offering to the L**ORD** above his Nazirite vow, as he can afford, in exact accordance with the vow that he takes, then he shall do in addition to the law of the Nazirite.”

**22**  The L**ORD** spoke to Moses, saying,

**23**  “Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, Thus [†](#Nm_CR187) you shall bless the people of Israel: you shall say to them,

> **24** [✞] The L**ORD** [†](#Nm_CR188) bless you and [†](#Nm_CR189) keep you;

> **25** [✞] the L**ORD** [†](#Nm_CR190) make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you;

**27**  [†](#Nm_CR192) “So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.”7 [✞] On the day when Moses had finished [†](#Nm_CR193) setting up the tabernacle and had anointed and [†](#Nm_CR194) consecrated it with all its furnishings and had anointed and consecrated the altar with all its utensils,

**2**  [†](#Nm_CR195) the chiefs of Israel, heads of their fathers’ houses, who were the chiefs of the tribes, who were over those who were listed, approached

**3**  and brought their offerings before the L**ORD**, six wagons and twelve oxen, a wagon for every two of the chiefs, and for each one an ox. They brought them before the tabernacle.

**4**  Then the L**ORD** said to Moses,

**5**  “Accept these from them, that they may be used in the service of the tent of meeting, and give them to the Levites, to each man according to his service.”

**6**  So Moses took the wagons and the oxen and gave them to the Levites.

**7**  Two wagons and four oxen [†](#Nm_CR196) he gave to the sons of Gershon, according to their service.

**8**  And four wagons and eight oxen [†](#Nm_CR197) he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

**9**  But to the sons of Kohath he gave none, because they were charged with [†](#Nm_CR198) the service of the holy things that [†](#Nm_CR199) had to be carried on the shoulder.

**10**  And the chiefs offered offerings for the [†](#Nm_CR200) dedication of the altar on the day it was anointed; and the chiefs offered their offering before the altar.

**11**  And the L**ORD** said to Moses, “They shall offer their offerings, one chief each day, for the dedication of the altar.”

**12**  He who offered his offering the first day was [†](#Nm_CR201) Nahshon the son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah.

**13**  And his offering was one silver plate whose weight was 130 shekels, [*](#Nm_NB12) one silver basin of 70 shekels, according to [†](#Nm_CR202) the shekel of the sanctuary, both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a [†](#Nm_CR203) grain offering;

**89** [✞] And when Moses went into the tent of meeting [†](#Nm_CR220) to speak with the L**ORD**, he heard [†](#Nm_CR221) the voice speaking to him from above the mercy seat that was on the ark of the testimony, from between the two cherubim; and it spoke to him.8 Now the L**ORD** spoke to Moses, saying,

**2**  “Speak to Aaron and say to him, When you set up the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand.”

**3**  And Aaron did so: he set up its lamps in front of the lampstand, as the L**ORD** commanded Moses.

**4**  And [†](#Nm_CR222) this was the workmanship of the lampstand, hammered work of gold. From its base to its flowers, it was hammered work; according to the pattern that the L**ORD** had shown Moses, so he made the lampstand.

**5** [✞] And the L**ORD** spoke to Moses, saying,

**6**  “Take the Levites from among the people of Israel and cleanse them.

**7**  Thus you shall do to them to cleanse them: sprinkle the [†](#Nm_CR223) water of purification upon them, and [†](#Nm_CR224) let them go with a razor over all their body, and wash their clothes and cleanse themselves.

**8**  Then let them take a bull from the herd and [†](#Nm_CR225) its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, [†](#Nm_CR226) and you shall take another bull from the herd for a sin offering.

**9**  [†](#Nm_CR227) And you shall bring the Levites before the tent of meeting [†](#Nm_CR228) and assemble the whole congregation of the people of Israel.

**10**  When you bring the Levites before the L**ORD**, the people of Israel [†](#Nm_CR229) shall lay their hands on the Levites,

**11**  and Aaron shall offer the Levites before the L**ORD** as a wave offering from the people of Israel, that they may do the service of the L**ORD**.

**12**  Then the Levites [†](#Nm_CR230) shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, and you shall offer [†](#Nm_CR231) the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to the L**ORD** to make atonement for the Levites.

**13**  And you shall set the Levites before Aaron and his sons, and shall offer them as [†](#Nm_CR232) a wave offering to the L**ORD**.

**14**  “Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the people of Israel, and [†](#Nm_CR233) the Levites shall be mine.

**15**  And after that the Levites shall go in to serve at the tent of meeting, when you have cleansed them and offered them as a [†](#Nm_CR234) wave offering.

**16**  For they are [†](#Nm_CR235) wholly given to me from among the people of Israel. [†](#Nm_CR236) Instead of all who open the womb, the firstborn of all the people of Israel, I have taken them for myself.

**17**  [†](#Nm_CR237) For all the firstborn among the people of Israel are mine, both of man and of beast. On the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I consecrated them for myself,

**18** [✞] and I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the people of Israel.

**19**  [†](#Nm_CR238) And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the people of Israel, to do the service for the people of Israel at the tent of meeting and [†](#Nm_CR239) to make atonement for the people of Israel, [†](#Nm_CR240) that there may be no plague among the people of Israel when the people of Israel come near the sanctuary.”

**20**  Thus did Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the people of Israel to the Levites. According to all that the L**ORD** commanded Moses concerning the Levites, the people of Israel did to them.

**21**  And [†](#Nm_CR241) the Levites purified themselves from sin and washed their clothes, and [†](#Nm_CR242) Aaron offered them as a wave offering before the L**ORD**, and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them.

**22**  And after that the Levites went in to do their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron and his sons; as the L**ORD** had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them.

**23**  And the L**ORD** spoke to Moses, saying,

**24** [✞] “This applies to the Levites: [†](#Nm_CR243) from twenty-five years old and upward they [*](#Nm_NB13) shall come to do duty in the service of the tent of meeting.

**25**  And from the age of fifty years they shall withdraw from the duty of the service and serve no more.

**26**  They minister [*](#Nm_NB14) to their brothers in the tent of meeting [†](#Nm_CR244) by keeping guard, but they shall do no service. Thus shall you do to the Levites in assigning their duties.”9 And the L**ORD** spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, [†](#Nm_CR245) in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,

**2**  “Let the people of Israel keep the Passover at its appointed time.

**3**  [†](#Nm_CR246) On the fourteenth day of this month, at twilight, you shall keep it at its appointed time; according to all its statutes and all its rules you shall keep it.”

**4**  So Moses told the people of Israel that they should keep the Passover.

**5**  And they kept the Passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at twilight, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the L**ORD** commanded Moses, so the people of Israel did.

**6** [✞] And there were certain men who were [†](#Nm_CR247) unclean through touching a dead body, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day, and [†](#Nm_CR248) they came before Moses and Aaron on that day.

**7**  And those men said to him, “We are unclean through touching a dead body. Why are we kept from bringing the L**ORD**’s [†](#Nm_CR249) offering at its appointed time among the people of Israel?”

**8**  And Moses said to them, “Wait, that [†](#Nm_CR250) I may hear what the L**ORD** will command concerning you.”

**9**  The L**ORD** spoke to Moses, saying,

**10**  “Speak to the people of Israel, saying, If any one of you or of your descendants is unclean through touching a dead body, or is on a long journey, he shall still keep the Passover to the L**ORD**.

**11**  [†](#Nm_CR251) In the second month on the fourteenth day at twilight they shall keep it. [†](#Nm_CR252) They shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.

**12**  [†](#Nm_CR253) They shall leave none of it until the morning, [†](#Nm_CR254) nor break any of its bones; [†](#Nm_CR255) according to all the statute for the Passover they shall keep it.

**13**  But if anyone who is clean and is not on a journey fails to keep the Passover, [†](#Nm_CR256) that person shall be cut off from his people because he did not bring the L**ORD**’s [†](#Nm_CR257) offering at its appointed time; that man shall bear his sin.

**14** [✞] And if a stranger sojourns among you and would keep the Passover to the L**ORD**, according to the statute of the Passover and according to its rule, so shall he do. [†](#Nm_CR258) You shall have one statute, both for the sojourner and for the native.”

**15** [✞] [†](#Nm_CR259) On the day that the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the testimony. And [†](#Nm_CR260) at evening it was over the tabernacle like the appearance of fire until morning.

**16**  So it was always: the cloud covered it by day [*](#Nm_NB15) and the appearance of fire by night.

**17**  And whenever the cloud [†](#Nm_CR261) lifted from over the tent, after that the people of Israel set out, and in the place where the cloud settled down, there the people of Israel camped.

**18**  At the command of the L**ORD** the people of Israel set out, and at the command of the L**ORD** they camped. [†](#Nm_CR262) As long as the cloud rested over the tabernacle, they remained in camp.

**19**  Even when the cloud continued over the tabernacle many days, the people of Israel [†](#Nm_CR263) kept the charge of the L**ORD** and did not set out.

**20**  Sometimes the cloud was a few days over the tabernacle, and according to the command of the L**ORD** they remained in camp; then according to the command of the L**ORD** they set out.

**21**  And sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning. And when the cloud lifted in the morning, they set out, or if it continued for a day and a night, when the cloud lifted they set out.

**22**  Whether it was two days, or a month, or a longer time, that the cloud continued over the tabernacle, abiding there, the people of Israel [†](#Nm_CR264) remained in camp and did not set out, but when it lifted they set out.

**23**  At the command of the L**ORD** they camped, and at the command of the L**ORD** they set out. [†](#Nm_CR265) They kept the charge of the L**ORD**, at the command of the L**ORD** by Moses.10 The L**ORD** spoke to Moses, saying,

**2**  “Make two silver trumpets. Of hammered work you shall make them, and you shall use them for [†](#Nm_CR266) summoning the congregation and for breaking camp.

**3**  And when [†](#Nm_CR267) both are blown, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the entrance of the tent of meeting.

**4**  But if they blow only one, then [†](#Nm_CR268) the chiefs, the heads of the tribes of Israel, shall gather themselves to you.

**5**  When you blow an alarm, [†](#Nm_CR269) the camps that are on the east side shall set out.

**6**  And when you blow an alarm the second time, [†](#Nm_CR270) the camps that are on the south side shall set out. An alarm is to be blown whenever they are to set out.

**7**  But when the assembly is to be gathered together, [†](#Nm_CR271) you shall blow a long blast, but you shall not [†](#Nm_CR272) sound an alarm.

**8**  [†](#Nm_CR273) And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets. The trumpets shall be to you for a perpetual statute throughout your generations.

**9**  And [†](#Nm_CR274) when you go to war in your land against the adversary who [†](#Nm_CR275) oppresses you, then you shall [†](#Nm_CR276) sound an alarm with the trumpets, that you may be [†](#Nm_CR277) remembered before the L**ORD** your God, and you shall be saved from your enemies.

**10**  [†](#Nm_CR278) On the day of your gladness also, and at your appointed feasts and [†](#Nm_CR279) at the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings. They shall be [†](#Nm_CR280) a reminder of you before your God: I am the L**ORD** your God.”

**11** [✞] In the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, [†](#Nm_CR281) the cloud lifted from over the tabernacle of the testimony,

**12**  and the people of Israel [†](#Nm_CR282) set out by stages from the [†](#Nm_CR283) wilderness of Sinai. And the cloud settled down in the [†](#Nm_CR284) wilderness of Paran.

**13**  They set out for the first time [†](#Nm_CR285) at the command of the L**ORD** by Moses.

**14** [✞] The standard of the camp of the people of Judah set out [†](#Nm_CR286) first by their companies, and over their company was [†](#Nm_CR287) Nahshon the son of Amminadab.

**15**  And over the company of the tribe of the people of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar.

**16**  And over the company of the tribe of the people of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.

**17**  And when [†](#Nm_CR288) the tabernacle was taken down, the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, [†](#Nm_CR289) who carried the tabernacle, set out.

**18**  And [†](#Nm_CR290) the standard of the camp of Reuben set out by their companies, and over their company was [†](#Nm_CR291) Elizur the son of Shedeur.

**19**  And over the company of the tribe of the people of Simeon was [†](#Nm_CR292) Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.

**20**  And over the company of the tribe of the people of Gad was [†](#Nm_CR293) Eliasaph the son of [†](#Nm_CR294) Deuel.

**21**  Then the Kohathites set out, [†](#Nm_CR295) carrying the holy things, and [†](#Nm_CR296) the tabernacle was set up before their arrival.

**22**  And [†](#Nm_CR297) the standard of the camp of the people of Ephraim set out by their companies, and over their company was [†](#Nm_CR298) Elishama the son of Ammihud.

**23**  And over the company of the tribe of the people of Manasseh was [†](#Nm_CR299) Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.

**24**  And over the company of the tribe of the people of Benjamin was [†](#Nm_CR300) Abidan the son of Gideoni.

**25**  Then [†](#Nm_CR301) the standard of the camp of the people of Dan, acting as the [†](#Nm_CR302) rear guard of all the camps, set out by their companies, and over their company was [†](#Nm_CR303) Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.

**26**  And over the company of the tribe of the people of Asher was [†](#Nm_CR304) Pagiel the son of Ochran.

**27**  And over the company of the tribe of the people of Naphtali was [†](#Nm_CR305) Ahira the son of Enan.

**28**  [†](#Nm_CR306) This was the order of march of the people of Israel by their companies, when they set out.

**29** [✞] And Moses said to Hobab the son of [†](#Nm_CR307) Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, “We are setting out for the place of which the L**ORD** said, [†](#Nm_CR308) ‘I will give it to you.’ Come with us, and we will do good to you, for [†](#Nm_CR309) the L**ORD** has promised good to Israel.”

**30**  But he said to him, “I will not go. I will depart to my own land and to my kindred.”

**31**  And he said, “Please do not leave us, for you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you will serve [†](#Nm_CR310) as eyes for us.

**32**  And if you do go with us, [†](#Nm_CR311) whatever good the L**ORD** will do to us, the same will we do to you.”

**33**  So they set out from [†](#Nm_CR312) the mount of the L**ORD** three days’ journey. And the ark of the covenant of the L**ORD** went before them three days’ journey, to seek out [†](#Nm_CR313) a resting place for them.

**34**  [†](#Nm_CR314) And the cloud of the L**ORD** was over them by day, whenever they set out from the camp.

**35** [✞] And whenever the ark set out, Moses said, [†](#Nm_CR315) “Arise, O L**ORD**, and let your enemies be scattered, and let those who hate you flee before you.”

**36**  And when it rested, he said, “Return, O L**ORD**, to the ten thousand thousands of Israel.”11 And [†](#Nm_CR316) the people complained in the hearing of the L**ORD** about their misfortunes, and when the L**ORD** heard it, [†](#Nm_CR317) his anger was kindled, and [†](#Nm_CR318) the fire of the L**ORD** burned among them and consumed some outlying parts of the camp.

**2**  Then [†](#Nm_CR319) the people cried out to Moses, [†](#Nm_CR320) and Moses prayed to the L**ORD**, and the fire died down.

**3**  So the name of that place was called [†](#Nm_CR321) Taberah, [*](#Nm_NB16) because the fire of the L**ORD** burned among them.

**4** [✞] Now the [†](#Nm_CR322) rabble that was among them had a strong craving. And the people of Israel also [†](#Nm_CR323) wept again and said, [†](#Nm_CR324) “Oh that we had meat to eat!

**5**  [†](#Nm_CR325) We remember the fish we ate in Egypt that cost nothing, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic.

**6**  But now our strength is dried up, and there is nothing at all but this manna to look at.”

**7** [✞] Now [†](#Nm_CR326) the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like that of bdellium.

**8**  [†](#Nm_CR327) The people went about and gathered it and ground it in handmills or beat it in mortars and boiled it in pots and made cakes of it. [†](#Nm_CR328) And the taste of it was like the taste of cakes baked with oil.

**9**  [†](#Nm_CR329) When the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell with it.

**10**  Moses heard the people [†](#Nm_CR330) weeping throughout their clans, everyone at the door of his tent. And the anger of the L**ORD** blazed hotly, and Moses was displeased.

**11**  [†](#Nm_CR331) Moses said to the L**ORD**, “Why have you dealt ill with your servant? And why have I not found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me?

**12**  Did I conceive all this people? Did I give them birth, that you should say to me, [†](#Nm_CR332) ‘Carry them in your bosom, as a [†](#Nm_CR333) nurse carries a nursing child,’ to the land [†](#Nm_CR334) that you swore to give their fathers?

**13**  [†](#Nm_CR335) Where am I to get meat to give to all this people? For they weep before me and say, ‘Give us meat, that we may eat.’

**14**  [†](#Nm_CR336) I am not able to carry all this people alone; the burden is too heavy for me.

**15**  If you will treat me like this, kill me at once, if I find favor in your sight, that I may not see my wretchedness.”

**16**  Then the L**ORD** said to Moses, “Gather for me [†](#Nm_CR337) seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and [†](#Nm_CR338) officers over them, and bring them to the tent of meeting, and let them take their stand there with you.

**17**  [†](#Nm_CR339) And I will come down and talk with you there. And [†](#Nm_CR340) I will take some of the Spirit that is on you and put it on them, and [†](#Nm_CR341) they shall bear the burden of the people with you, so that you may not bear it yourself alone.

**18**  And say to the people, [†](#Nm_CR342) ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat, for you have wept in the hearing of the L**ORD**, saying, “Who will give us meat to eat? [†](#Nm_CR343) For it was better for us in Egypt.” Therefore the L**ORD** will give you meat, and you shall eat.

**19**  You shall not eat just one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days,

**20**  but a whole month, [†](#Nm_CR344) until it comes out at your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you, because you have rejected the L**ORD** who is among you and have wept before him, saying, [†](#Nm_CR345) “Why did we come out of Egypt?”’”

**21**  But Moses said, [†](#Nm_CR346) “The people among whom I am number six hundred thousand on foot, and you have said, ‘I will give them meat, that they may eat a whole month!’

**22**  [†](#Nm_CR347) Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, and be enough for them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, and be enough for them?”

**23**  And the L**ORD** said to Moses, [†](#Nm_CR348) “Is the L**ORD**’s hand shortened? Now you shall see whether [†](#Nm_CR349) my word will come true for you or not.”

**24**  So Moses went out and told the people the words of the L**ORD**. [†](#Nm_CR350) And he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people and placed them around the tent.

**25** [✞] Then [†](#Nm_CR351) the L**ORD** came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and took some of the Spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders. And as soon as the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied. But they did not continue doing it.

**26**  Now two men remained in the camp, one named Eldad, and the other named Medad, and the Spirit rested on them. They were among those registered, but they [†](#Nm_CR352) had not gone out to the tent, and so they prophesied in the camp.

**27**  And a young man ran and told Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.”

**28**  And [†](#Nm_CR353) Joshua the son of Nun, the assistant of Moses from his youth, said, “My lord Moses, [†](#Nm_CR354) stop them.”

**29**  But Moses said to him, “Are you jealous for my sake? [†](#Nm_CR355) Would that all the L**ORD**’s people were prophets, that the L**ORD** would put his Spirit on them!”

**30**  And Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.

**31** [✞] Then a [†](#Nm_CR356) wind from the L**ORD** sprang up, and it brought quail from the sea and let them fall beside the camp, about a day’s journey on this side and a day’s journey on the other side, around the camp, and about two cubits [*](#Nm_NB17) above the ground.

**32**  And the people rose all that day and all night and all the next day, and gathered the quail. Those who gathered least gathered ten [†](#Nm_CR357) homers. [*](#Nm_NB18) And they spread them out for themselves all around the camp.

**33**  [†](#Nm_CR358) While the meat was yet between their teeth, before it was consumed, the anger of the L**ORD** was kindled against the people, and [†](#Nm_CR359) the L**ORD** struck down the people with a very great plague.

**34**  Therefore the name of that place was called [†](#Nm_CR360) Kibroth-hattaavah, [*](#Nm_NB19) because there they buried the people who had the craving.

**35**  [†](#Nm_CR361) From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed to [†](#Nm_CR362) Hazeroth, and they remained at [†](#Nm_CR362) Hazeroth.12 [✞] Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married, for he had married a Cushite woman.

**2** [✞] And they said, “Has the L**ORD** indeed spoken only through Moses? [†](#Nm_CR363) Has he not spoken through us also?” And [†](#Nm_CR364) the L**ORD** heard it.

**3** [✞] Now the man Moses was very meek, more than all people who were on the face of the earth.

**4**  And suddenly the L**ORD** said to Moses and to Aaron and Miriam, “Come out, you three, to the tent of meeting.” And the three of them came out.

**5** [✞] And [†](#Nm_CR365) the L**ORD** came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the tent and called Aaron and Miriam, and they both came forward.

**6** [✞] And he said, “Hear my words: If there is a prophet among you, I the L**ORD** make myself known to him [†](#Nm_CR366) in a vision; I speak with him [†](#Nm_CR367) in a dream.

**7** [✞] Not so with [†](#Nm_CR368) my servant Moses. [†](#Nm_CR369) He is faithful in all my house.

**8** [✞] With him I speak [†](#Nm_CR370) mouth to mouth, clearly, and not in [†](#Nm_CR371) riddles, and he beholds [†](#Nm_CR372) the form of the L**ORD**. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?”

**9**  And the anger of the L**ORD** was kindled against them, and he departed.

**10** [✞] When the cloud removed from over the tent, behold, [†](#Nm_CR373) Miriam was [†](#Nm_CR374) leprous, [*](#Nm_NB20) like snow. And Aaron turned toward Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.

**11**  And Aaron said to Moses, “Oh, my lord, [†](#Nm_CR375) do not punish us [*](#Nm_NB21) because we have done foolishly and have sinned.

**12**  Let her not be as one dead, whose flesh is half eaten away when he comes out of his mother’s womb.”

**13**  And Moses cried to the L**ORD**, “O God, please heal her—please.”

**14**  But the L**ORD** said to Moses, “If her father had but [†](#Nm_CR376) spit in her face, should she not be shamed seven days? Let her be [†](#Nm_CR377) shut outside the camp seven days, and after that she may be brought in again.”

**15**  So Miriam [†](#Nm_CR378) was shut outside the camp seven days, and the people did not set out on the march till Miriam was brought in again.

**16** [✞] After that the people set out from [†](#Nm_CR379) Hazeroth, and camped in [†](#Nm_CR380) the wilderness of Paran.
