### Edom Will Be Humbled

**1** [✞] The vision of Obadiah.

> Thus says the Lord G**OD** [†](#Obtext_EFN1) concerning Edom:

> [†](#Obtext_EFN2) We have heard a report from the L**ORD**,

  > and a messenger has been sent among the nations:

> “Rise up! Let us rise against her for battle!”

> **2** [✞] Behold, I will make you small among the nations;

  > you shall be utterly despised. [*](#Ob_NC1)

> **3** [✞] [†](#Obtext_EFN3) The pride of your heart has deceived you,

  > you who live in the clefts of the rock, [*](#Ob_NC2)

  > in your lofty dwelling,

> [†](#Obtext_EFN4) who say in your heart,

  > “Who will bring me down to the ground?”

> **4** [✞] Though you soar aloft like the eagle,

  > though your nest is set among the stars,

  > from there I will bring you down,

> **5** [✞] If [†](#Obtext_EFN5) thieves came to you,

  > if plunderers came by night—

  > how you have been destroyed!—

  > would they not steal only enough for themselves?

> If [†](#Obtext_EFN5) grape gatherers came to you,

  > would they not leave gleanings?

> **6**  [†](#Obtext_EFN6) How Esau has been pillaged,

  > his treasures sought out!

> **7** [✞] All your allies have driven you to your border;

  > those at peace with you have deceived you;

> they have prevailed against you;

  > [†](#Obtext_EFN7) those who eat your bread [*](#Ob_NC3) have set a trap beneath you—

  > [†](#Obtext_EFN8) you have [*](#Ob_NC4) no understanding.

> **8** [✞] [†](#Obtext_EFN9) Will I not on that day, declares the L**ORD**,

  > destroy the wise men out of Edom,

  > and understanding out of [†](#Obtext_EFN10) Mount Esau?

> **9** [✞] And your mighty men shall be dismayed, [†](#Obtext_EFN11) O Teman,

  > so that every man from [†](#Obtext_EFN12) Mount Esau will be cut off by slaughter.

> **10**  [†](#Obtext_EFN13) Because of the violence done to your brother Jacob,

  > shame shall cover you,

  > [†](#Obtext_EFN14) and you shall be cut off forever.

> **11** [✞] [†](#Obtext_EFN15) On the day that you stood aloof,

  > [†](#Obtext_EFN16) on the day that strangers carried off his wealth

> and foreigners entered his gates

  > [†](#Obtext_EFN17) and cast lots for Jerusalem,

  > you were like one of them.

> **12** [✞] [†](#Obtext_EFN18) But do not gloat over the day of your brother

  > in the day of his misfortune;

> [†](#Obtext_EFN19) do not rejoice over the people of Judah

  > in the day of their ruin;

> [†](#Obtext_EFN20) do not boast [*](#Ob_NC5)

  > in the day of distress.

> **13**  [†](#Obtext_EFN21) Do not enter the gate of my people

  > in the day of their calamity;

> [†](#Obtext_EFN21) do not gloat over his disaster

  > in the day of his calamity;

> [†](#Obtext_EFN22) do not loot his wealth

  > in the day of his calamity.

> **14**  [†](#Obtext_EFN23) Do not stand at the crossroads

  > to cut off his fugitives;

> do not hand over his survivors

  > in the day of distress.

> **15** [✞] For [†](#Obtext_EFN24) the day of the L**ORD** is near upon all the nations.

> [†](#Obtext_EFN25) As you have done, it shall be done to you;

  > your deeds shall return on your own head.

> **16** [✞] [†](#Obtext_EFN26) For as you have drunk on [†](#Obtext_EFN27) my holy mountain,

  > so all the nations shall drink continually;

> they shall drink and swallow,

  > and shall be as though they had never been.

> **17** [✞] [†](#Obtext_EFN28) But in Mount Zion there shall be those who escape,

  > and it shall be holy,

> [†](#Obtext_EFN29) and the house of Jacob shall possess their own possessions.

> **18** [✞] [†](#Obtext_EFN30) The house of Jacob shall be a fire,

  > and the house of Joseph a flame,

  > and the house of Esau [†](#Obtext_EFN31) stubble;

> they shall burn them and consume them,

  > [†](#Obtext_EFN32) and there shall be no survivor for the house of Esau,

> **19** [✞] Those of [†](#Obtext_EFN33) the Negeb [†](#Obtext_EFN34) shall possess [†](#Obtext_EFN35) Mount Esau,

  > and those of the Shephelah shall possess [†](#Obtext_EFN36) the land of the Philistines;

> they shall possess the land of Ephraim and the land of [†](#Obtext_EFN37) Samaria,

  > and Benjamin shall possess Gilead.

> **20** [✞] The exiles of this host of the people of Israel

  > shall possess the land of the Canaanites as far as [†](#Obtext_EFN38) Zarephath,

> and the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad

  > shall possess the cities of the Negeb.

> **21** [✞] [†](#Obtext_EFN39) Saviors shall go up to Mount Zion

  > to rule [†](#Obtext_EFN40) Mount Esau,

  > and [†](#Obtext_EFN41) the kingdom shall be the L**ORD**’s.
