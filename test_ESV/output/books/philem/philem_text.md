### Greeting

**1** [✞] Paul, [†](#Phlmtext_EFN1) a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and [†](#Phlmtext_EFN2) Timothy our brother,To Philemon our beloved fellow worker

**2** [✞] and Apphia our sister and [†](#Phlmtext_EFN3) Archippus our [†](#Phlmtext_EFN4) fellow soldier, and [†](#Phlmtext_EFN5) the church in your house:

**3**  [†](#Phlmtext_EFN6) Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

**4**  [†](#Phlmtext_EFN7) I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers,

**5**  because I [†](#Phlmtext_EFN8) hear of your love and [†](#Phlmtext_EFN9) of the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints,

**6** [✞] and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full [†](#Phlmtext_EFN10) knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ. [*](#Phlm_NC1)

**7** [✞] For I have derived much joy and [†](#Phlmtext_EFN11) comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints [†](#Phlmtext_EFN12) have been refreshed through you.

**8** [✞] Accordingly, [†](#Phlmtext_EFN13) though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do [†](#Phlmtext_EFN14) what is required,

**9** [✞] yet for love’s sake I prefer to appeal to you—I, Paul, an old man and now [†](#Phlmtext_EFN15) a prisoner also for Christ Jesus—

**10** [✞] I appeal to you for [†](#Phlmtext_EFN16) my child, [†](#Phlmtext_EFN17) Onesimus, [*](#Phlm_NC2) [†](#Phlmtext_EFN18) whose father I became in my imprisonment.

**11** [✞] (Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me.)

**12** [✞] I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart.

**13**  I would have been glad to keep him with me, in order that he might serve me [†](#Phlmtext_EFN19) on your behalf [†](#Phlmtext_EFN20) during my imprisonment for the gospel,

**14** [✞] but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be [†](#Phlmtext_EFN21) by compulsion but of your own accord.

**15**  For this perhaps is why [†](#Phlmtext_EFN22) he was parted from you for a while, that you might have him back forever,

**16** [✞] [†](#Phlmtext_EFN23) no longer as a bondservant [*](#Phlm_NC3) but more than a bondservant, as [†](#Phlmtext_EFN24) a beloved brother—especially to me, but how much more to you, [†](#Phlmtext_EFN25) both in the flesh and in the Lord.

**17** [✞] So if you consider me [†](#Phlmtext_EFN26) your partner, receive him as you would receive me.

**18**  If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account.

**19** [✞] [†](#Phlmtext_EFN27) I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it—to say nothing of your owing me even your own self.

**20** [✞] Yes, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. [†](#Phlmtext_EFN28) Refresh my heart in Christ.

**21**  [†](#Phlmtext_EFN29) Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.

**22** [✞] At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for [†](#Phlmtext_EFN30) I am hoping that [†](#Phlmtext_EFN31) through your prayers [†](#Phlmtext_EFN32) I will be graciously given to you.

**23** [✞] [†](#Phlmtext_EFN33) Epaphras, my [†](#Phlmtext_EFN34) fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you,

**24** [✞] and so do [†](#Phlmtext_EFN35) Mark, [†](#Phlmtext_EFN34) Aristarchus, [†](#Phlmtext_EFN36) Demas, and [†](#Phlmtext_EFN36) Luke, my fellow workers.

**25**  [†](#Phlmtext_EFN37) The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
