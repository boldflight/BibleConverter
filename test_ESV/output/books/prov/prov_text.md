### The Beginning of Knowledge

1 [✞] [†](#Prv_CR1) The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:

> **2** [✞] To know wisdom and instruction,

  > to understand words of insight,

> **3** [✞] to receive instruction in wise dealing,

  > in [†](#Prv_CR2) righteousness, justice, and equity;

> **4** [✞] to give prudence to [†](#Prv_CR3) the simple,

  > knowledge and [†](#Prv_CR4) discretion to the youth—

> **5** [✞] Let the wise hear and [†](#Prv_CR5) increase in learning,

  > and the one who understands obtain guidance,

> **6** [✞] to understand a proverb and a saying,

  > [†](#Prv_CR6) the words of the wise and their [†](#Prv_CR7) riddles.

> **7** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR8) The fear of the L**ORD** is the beginning of knowledge;

  > fools despise wisdom and instruction.

> **8** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR9) Hear, my son, your father’s instruction,

  > and forsake not your mother’s teaching,

> **9** [✞] for they are [†](#Prv_CR10) a graceful garland for your head

  > and [†](#Prv_CR11) pendants for your neck.

> **10** [✞] My son, if sinners [†](#Prv_CR12) entice you,

  > do not consent.

> **11**  If they say, “Come with us, [†](#Prv_CR13) let us lie in wait for blood;

  > [†](#Prv_CR14) let us ambush the innocent without reason;

> **12** [✞] like Sheol let us [†](#Prv_CR15) swallow them alive,

  > and whole, like [†](#Prv_CR16) those who go down to the pit;

> **13** [✞] we shall find all precious goods,

  > we shall fill our houses with plunder;

> **14**  throw in your lot among us;

  > we will all have one purse”—

> **15** [✞] my son, [†](#Prv_CR17) do not walk in the way with them;

  > [†](#Prv_CR18) hold back your foot from their paths,

> **16** [✞] for [†](#Prv_CR19) their feet run to evil,

  > and they make haste to shed blood.

> **17** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR20) For in vain is a net spread

  > in the sight of any bird,

> **18** [✞] but these men [†](#Prv_CR21) lie in wait for their own blood;

  > they [†](#Prv_CR21) set an ambush for their own lives.

> **19** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR22) Such are the ways of everyone who is [†](#Prv_CR23) greedy for unjust gain;

  > [†](#Prv_CR24) it takes away the life of its possessors.

> **20** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR25) Wisdom cries aloud in the street,

  > in the markets she raises her voice;

> **21** [✞] at the head of the noisy streets she cries out;

  > at [†](#Prv_CR26) the entrance of the city gates she speaks:

> **22** [✞] “How long, O [†](#Prv_CR27) simple ones, will you love being simple?

> How long will [†](#Prv_CR28) scoffers delight in their scoffing

  > and fools [†](#Prv_CR29) hate knowledge?

> **23** [✞] If you turn at my reproof, [*](#Prv_NC1)

> behold, I will [†](#Prv_CR30) pour out my spirit to you;

  > I will make my words known to you.

> **24** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR31) Because I have called and [†](#Prv_CR32) you refused to listen,

  > have [†](#Prv_CR33) stretched out my hand and no one has heeded,

> **25** [✞] because you have [†](#Prv_CR34) ignored all my counsel

  > and [†](#Prv_CR35) would have none of my reproof,

> **26** [✞] I also [†](#Prv_CR36) will laugh at your calamity;

  > I will mock when [†](#Prv_CR37) terror strikes you,

> **27** [✞] when terror strikes you like [†](#Prv_CR38) a storm

  > and your calamity comes like a whirlwind,

  > when distress and anguish come upon you.

> **28** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR39) Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer;

  > they will seek me diligently but will not find me.

> **29** [✞] Because they [†](#Prv_CR40) hated knowledge

  > and [†](#Prv_CR41) did not choose the fear of the L**ORD**,

> **30**  [†](#Prv_CR42) would have none of my counsel

  > and [†](#Prv_CR43) despised all my reproof,

> **31** [✞] therefore they shall eat [†](#Prv_CR44) the fruit of their way,

  > and have [†](#Prv_CR45) their fill of their own devices.

> **32** [✞] For the simple are killed by [†](#Prv_CR46) their turning away,

  > and [†](#Prv_CR47) the complacency of fools destroys them;

> **33** [✞] but [†](#Prv_CR48) whoever listens to me will dwell secure

  > and will be [†](#Prv_CR49) at ease, without dread of disaster.”

> and treasure up my commandments with you,

> **2** [✞] making your ear attentive to wisdom

  > and inclining your heart to understanding;

> **3** [✞] yes, if you call out for insight

  > and raise your voice [†](#Prv_CR52) for understanding,

> **4** [✞] if you seek it like [†](#Prv_CR53) silver

  > and search for it as for [†](#Prv_CR54) hidden treasures,

> **5** [✞] then [†](#Prv_CR55) you will understand the fear of the L**ORD**

  > and find the knowledge of God.

> **6** [✞] For [†](#Prv_CR56) the L**ORD** gives wisdom;

  > from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;

> **7** [✞] he stores up sound wisdom for the upright;

  > he is [†](#Prv_CR57) a shield to those who [†](#Prv_CR58) walk in integrity,

> **8** [✞] guarding the paths of justice

  > and [†](#Prv_CR59) watching over the way of his [†](#Prv_CR60) saints.

> **9** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR61) Then you will understand [†](#Prv_CR62) righteousness and justice

  > and equity, every good path;

> **10**  for wisdom will come into your heart,

  > and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;

> **11** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR63) discretion will [†](#Prv_CR64) watch over you,

  > understanding will guard you,

> **12** [✞] delivering you from the way of evil,

  > from men of perverted speech,

> **13** [✞] who forsake the paths of uprightness

  > to [†](#Prv_CR65) walk in the ways of darkness,

> **14**  who [†](#Prv_CR66) rejoice in doing evil

  > and [†](#Prv_CR67) delight in the perverseness of evil,

> **15**  men whose [†](#Prv_CR68) paths are crooked,

  > [†](#Prv_CR69) and who are [†](#Prv_CR70) devious in their ways.

> **16** [✞] So [†](#Prv_CR71) you will be delivered from the forbidden [*](#Prv_NC2) woman,

  > from [†](#Prv_CR72) the adulteress [*](#Prv_NC3) with [†](#Prv_CR73) her smooth words,

> **17** [✞] who forsakes [†](#Prv_CR74) the companion of her youth

  > and forgets [†](#Prv_CR75) the covenant of her God;

> **18** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR76) for her house sinks down to death,

  > and her paths to the departed; [*](#Prv_NC4)

> **19** [✞] none who go to her come back,

  > nor do they regain the paths of life.

> **20** [✞] So you will walk in the way of the good

  > and keep to the paths of the righteous.

> **21** [✞] For the upright [†](#Prv_CR77) will inhabit the land,

  > and those with integrity will remain in it,

> **22**  but the wicked will be [†](#Prv_CR78) cut off from the land,

  > and the treacherous will be [†](#Prv_CR79) rooted out of it.

> [†](#Prv_CR81) but let your heart keep my commandments,

> **2** [✞] for [†](#Prv_CR82) length of days and years of life

  > and [†](#Prv_CR83) peace they will add to you.

> **3** [✞] Let not [†](#Prv_CR84) steadfast love and [†](#Prv_CR85) faithfulness forsake you;

  > [†](#Prv_CR86) bind them around your neck;

  > [†](#Prv_CR87) write them on the tablet of your heart.

> **4** [✞] So you will [†](#Prv_CR88) find favor and [†](#Prv_CR89) good success [*](#Prv_NC5)

  > in the sight of God and man.

> **5** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR90) Trust in the L**ORD** with all your heart,

  > and [†](#Prv_CR91) do not lean on your own understanding.

> **6** [✞] In all your ways [†](#Prv_CR92) acknowledge him,

  > and he [†](#Prv_CR93) will make straight your paths.

> **7** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR94) Be not wise in your own eyes;

  > [†](#Prv_CR95) fear the L**ORD**, and turn away from evil.

> **8** [✞] It will be [†](#Prv_CR96) healing to your flesh [*](#Prv_NC6)

  > and [†](#Prv_CR97) refreshment [*](#Prv_NC7) to your bones.

> **9** [✞] Honor the L**ORD** with your wealth

  > and with [†](#Prv_CR98) the firstfruits of all your produce;

> **10** [✞] then your [†](#Prv_CR99) barns will be filled with plenty,

  > and your vats will be bursting with wine.

> **11** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR100) My son, do not despise the L**ORD**’s discipline

  > or be weary of his reproof,

> **12** [✞] for the L**ORD** reproves him whom he loves,

  > as [†](#Prv_CR101) a father the son in whom he delights.

> **13** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR102) Blessed is the one who finds wisdom,

  > and the one who gets understanding,

> **14** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR103) for the gain from her is better than gain from silver

  > and her profit better than [†](#Prv_CR104) gold.

> **15** [✞] She is more precious than [†](#Prv_CR105) jewels,

  > and [†](#Prv_CR106) nothing you desire can compare with her.

> **16** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR107) Long life is in her right hand;

  > in her left hand are [†](#Prv_CR108) riches and honor.

> **17** [✞] Her [†](#Prv_CR109) ways are ways of pleasantness,

  > and all her paths are peace.

> **18** [✞] She is [†](#Prv_CR110) a tree of life to those who [†](#Prv_CR111) lay hold of her;

  > those who hold her fast are called blessed.

> **19** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR112) The L**ORD** by wisdom founded the earth;

  > by understanding [†](#Prv_CR112) he established the heavens;

> **20** [✞] by his knowledge [†](#Prv_CR113) the deeps broke open,

  > and [†](#Prv_CR114) the clouds drop down the dew.

> **21** [✞] My son, [†](#Prv_CR115) do not lose sight of these—

  > keep sound wisdom and discretion,

> **22** [✞] and they will be [†](#Prv_CR116) life for your soul

  > and [†](#Prv_CR117) adornment for your neck.

> **23** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR118) Then you will walk on your way securely,

  > [†](#Prv_CR119) and your foot will not stumble.

> **24** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR120) If you lie down, you will not be afraid;

  > when you lie down, [†](#Prv_CR121) your sleep will be sweet.

> **25** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR122) Do not be afraid of sudden terror

  > or of [†](#Prv_CR123) the ruin [*](#Prv_NC8) of the wicked, when it comes,

> **26** [✞] for the L**ORD** will be your confidence

  > and will [†](#Prv_CR124) keep your foot from being caught.

> **27** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR125) Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, [*](#Prv_NC9)

  > when it is in your power to do it.

> **28**  [†](#Prv_CR126) Do not say to your neighbor, “Go, and come again,

  > tomorrow I will give it”—when you have it with you.

> **29**  [†](#Prv_CR127) Do not plan evil against your neighbor,

  > who [†](#Prv_CR128) dwells trustingly beside you.

> **30**  [†](#Prv_CR129) Do not contend with a man for no reason,

  > when he has done you no harm.

> **31**  [†](#Prv_CR130) Do not envy [†](#Prv_CR131) a man of violence

  > and do not choose any of his ways,

> **32** [✞] for [†](#Prv_CR132) the devious person is an abomination to the L**ORD**,

  > but the upright are [†](#Prv_CR133) in his confidence.

> **33** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR134) The L**ORD**’s curse is on the house of the wicked,

  > but he [†](#Prv_CR135) blesses the dwelling of the righteous.

> **34** [✞] Toward the [†](#Prv_CR136) scorners he [†](#Prv_CR137) is scornful,

  > [†](#Prv_CR138) but to the humble he gives favor. [*](#Prv_NC10)

> **35**  The wise will inherit honor,

  > but fools get [*](#Prv_NC11) disgrace.

> and be attentive, that you may [†](#Prv_CR140) gain [*](#Prv_NC12) insight,

> **2** [✞] for I give you good [†](#Prv_CR141) precepts;

  > do not forsake my teaching.

> **3** [✞] When I was a son with my father,

  > [†](#Prv_CR142) tender, [†](#Prv_CR143) the only one in the sight of my mother,

> **4** [✞] he [†](#Prv_CR144) taught me and said to me,

> [†](#Prv_CR145) “Let your heart hold fast my words;

  > [†](#Prv_CR146) keep my commandments, and live.

> **5**  [†](#Prv_CR147) Get wisdom; get [†](#Prv_CR148) insight;

  > do not forget, and do not turn away from the words of my mouth.

> **6** [✞] Do not forsake her, and she will keep you;

  > [†](#Prv_CR149) love her, and she will guard you.

> **7** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR150) The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom,

  > and whatever you get, get [†](#Prv_CR151) insight.

> **8** [✞] Prize her highly, and she will exalt you;

  > she will [†](#Prv_CR152) honor you [†](#Prv_CR153) if you embrace her.

> **9**  She will place on your head [†](#Prv_CR154) a graceful garland;

  > she will bestow on you a beautiful crown.”

> **10** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR155) Hear, [†](#Prv_CR156) my son, and accept my words,

  > that [†](#Prv_CR157) the years of your life may be many.

> **11** [✞] I have [†](#Prv_CR158) taught you the way of wisdom;

  > I have led you in the paths of uprightness.

> **12** [✞] When you walk, [†](#Prv_CR159) your step will not be hampered,

  > and [†](#Prv_CR160) if you run, you will not stumble.

> **13** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR161) Keep hold of instruction; do not let go;

  > guard her, for she is your [†](#Prv_CR162) life.

> **14** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR163) Do not enter the path of the wicked,

  > and do not walk in the way of the evil.

> **15**  Avoid it; do not go on it;

  > turn away from it and pass on.

> **16** [✞] For they [†](#Prv_CR164) cannot sleep unless they have done wrong;

  > they are robbed of sleep unless they have made someone stumble.

> **17** [✞] For they eat the bread of wickedness

  > [†](#Prv_CR165) and drink the wine of violence.

> **18** [✞] But [†](#Prv_CR166) the path of the righteous is like [†](#Prv_CR167) the light of dawn,

  > which shines [†](#Prv_CR168) brighter and brighter until [†](#Prv_CR169) full day.

> **19** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR170) The way of the wicked is like deep [†](#Prv_CR171) darkness;

  > they do not know over what they [†](#Prv_CR172) stumble.

> **20** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR173) My son, be attentive to my words;

  > incline your ear to my sayings.

> **21** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR174) Let them not escape from your sight;

  > [†](#Prv_CR175) keep them within your heart.

> **22** [✞] For they are [†](#Prv_CR176) life to those who find them,

  > and healing to all their [*](#Prv_NC13) flesh.

> **23** [✞] Keep your heart with all vigilance,

  > for [†](#Prv_CR177) from it flow [†](#Prv_CR178) the springs of life.

> **24** [✞] Put away from you [†](#Prv_CR179) crooked speech,

  > and put [†](#Prv_CR180) devious talk far from you.

> **25** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR181) Let your eyes look directly forward,

  > and your gaze be straight before you.

> **26** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR182) Ponder [*](#Prv_NC14) the path of your feet;

  > [†](#Prv_CR183) then all your ways will be sure.

> **27** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR184) Do not swerve to the right or to the left;

  > turn your foot away from evil.

> [†](#Prv_CR186) incline your ear to my understanding,

> **2** [✞] that you may keep [†](#Prv_CR187) discretion,

  > and your lips may [†](#Prv_CR188) guard knowledge.

> **3** [✞] For the lips of [†](#Prv_CR189) a forbidden [*](#Prv_NC15) woman drip honey,

  > and her speech [*](#Prv_NC16) is [†](#Prv_CR190) smoother than oil,

> **4** [✞] but in the end she is [†](#Prv_CR191) bitter as [†](#Prv_CR192) wormwood,

  > [†](#Prv_CR193) sharp as [†](#Prv_CR194) a two-edged sword.

> **5** [✞] Her feet [†](#Prv_CR195) go down to death;

  > her steps follow the path to [*](#Prv_NC17) Sheol;

> **6** [✞] she [†](#Prv_CR196) does not ponder the path of life;

  > her ways wander, and she does not know it.

> **7** [✞] And [†](#Prv_CR197) now, O sons, listen to me,

  > and do not depart from the words of my mouth.

> **8** [✞] Keep your way far from her,

  > and do not go near the door of her house,

> **9** [✞] lest you give your honor to others

  > and your years to the merciless,

> **10** [✞] lest strangers take their fill of your strength,

  > and your [†](#Prv_CR198) labors go to the house of a foreigner,

> **11** [✞] and at the end of your life you [†](#Prv_CR199) groan,

  > when your flesh and body are consumed,

> **12** [✞] and you say, [†](#Prv_CR200) “How I hated discipline,

  > and my heart [†](#Prv_CR201) despised reproof!

> **13** [✞] I did not listen to the voice of my teachers

  > or incline my ear to my instructors.

> **14** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR202) I am at the brink of utter ruin

  > in the assembled congregation.”

> **15** [✞] Drink [†](#Prv_CR203) water from your own cistern,

  > flowing water from your own well.

> **16** [✞] Should your [†](#Prv_CR204) springs be scattered abroad,

  > streams of water [†](#Prv_CR205) in the streets?

> **17**  [†](#Prv_CR206) Let them be for yourself alone,

  > and not for strangers with you.

> **18** [✞] Let your [†](#Prv_CR207) fountain be blessed,

  > and [†](#Prv_CR208) rejoice in [†](#Prv_CR209) the wife of your youth,

  > **19** [✞] a lovely [†](#Prv_CR210) deer, a graceful doe.

> Let her breasts [†](#Prv_CR211) fill you at all times with delight;

  > be intoxicated [*](#Prv_NC18) always in her love.

> **20**  Why should you be intoxicated, my son, with [†](#Prv_CR212) a forbidden woman

  > and embrace the bosom of [†](#Prv_CR212) an adulteress? [*](#Prv_NC19)

> **21** [✞] For [†](#Prv_CR213) a man’s ways are [†](#Prv_CR214) before the eyes of the L**ORD**,

  > and he [†](#Prv_CR215) ponders [*](#Prv_NC20) all his paths.

> **22** [✞] The [†](#Prv_CR216) iniquities of the wicked [†](#Prv_CR217) ensnare him,

  > and he is held fast in the cords of his sin.

> **23** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR218) He dies for lack of discipline,

  > and because of his great folly he is [†](#Prv_CR219) led astray.

> have [†](#Prv_CR220) given your pledge for a stranger,

> **2** [✞] if you are [†](#Prv_CR221) snared in the words of your mouth,

  > caught in the words of your mouth,

> **3** [✞] then do this, my son, and save yourself,

  > for you have come into the hand of your neighbor:

  > go, hasten, [*](#Prv_NC21) and [†](#Prv_CR222) plead urgently with your neighbor.

> **4** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR223) Give your eyes no sleep

  > and your eyelids no slumber;

> **5** [✞] save yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, [*](#Prv_NC22)

  > [†](#Prv_CR224) like a bird from the hand of the fowler.

> **6** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR225) Go to [†](#Prv_CR226) the ant, O [†](#Prv_CR227) sluggard;

  > consider her ways, and [†](#Prv_CR228) be wise.

> **7**  [†](#Prv_CR229) Without having any chief,

  > [†](#Prv_CR230) officer, or ruler,

> **8**  she prepares her bread [†](#Prv_CR231) in summer

  > and [†](#Prv_CR232) gathers her food in harvest.

> **9**  [†](#Prv_CR233) How long will you lie there, [†](#Prv_CR234) O sluggard?

  > When will you arise from your sleep?

> **10** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR235) A little sleep, a little slumber,

  > [†](#Prv_CR236) a little [†](#Prv_CR262)folding of the hands to rest,

> **11** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR237) and poverty will come upon you like a robber,

  > and want like an armed man.

> **12** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR238) A worthless person, a wicked man,

  > goes about with [†](#Prv_CR239) crooked speech,

> **13** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR240) winks with his eyes, signals [*](#Prv_NC23) with his feet,

  > points with his finger,

> **14**  with [†](#Prv_CR241) perverted heart [†](#Prv_CR242) devises evil,

  > continually [†](#Prv_CR243) sowing discord;

> **15** [✞] therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly;

  > [†](#Prv_CR244) in a moment he will be broken [†](#Prv_CR245) beyond healing.

> **16** [✞] There are [†](#Prv_CR246) six things that the L**ORD** hates,

  > [†](#Prv_CR246)seven that are an abomination to him:

> **17**  [†](#Prv_CR247) haughty eyes, [†](#Prv_CR248) a lying tongue,

  > and [†](#Prv_CR249) hands that shed innocent blood,

> **18**  [†](#Prv_CR250) a heart that devises wicked plans,

  > [†](#Prv_CR251) feet that make haste to run to evil,

> **19**  [†](#Prv_CR252) a false witness who [†](#Prv_CR253) breathes out lies,

  > and one who [†](#Prv_CR254) sows discord among brothers.

> **20** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR255) My son, keep your father’s commandment,

  > [†](#Prv_CR255) and forsake not your mother’s teaching.

> **21** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR256) Bind them on your heart always;

  > [†](#Prv_CR257) tie them around your neck.

> **22** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR258) When you walk, they [*](#Prv_NC24) will lead you;

  > [†](#Prv_CR258) when you lie down, they will [†](#Prv_CR259) watch over you;

  > and when you awake, they will talk with you.

> **23** [✞] For the commandment is [†](#Prv_CR260) a lamp and the teaching a light,

  > and the [†](#Prv_CR261) reproofs of discipline are the way of life,

> **24** [✞] to preserve you from the evil woman, [*](#Prv_NC25)

  > from the smooth tongue of [†](#Prv_CR262) the adulteress. [*](#Prv_NC26)

> **25** [✞] [†](#Prv_CR263) Do not desire her beauty in your heart,

  > and do not let her capture you with her [†](#Prv_CR264) eyelashes;

> **27** [✞] Her house is [†](#Prv_CR306) the way to Sheol,

  > going down to the chambers of death.

> Does not [†](#Prv_CR308) understanding raise her voice?

> **2**  On [†](#Prv_CR309) the heights beside the way,

  > at the crossroads she takes her stand;

  > and [†](#Prv_CR328) perverted speech I hate.

> **14** [✞] I have [†](#Prv_CR329) counsel and [†](#Prv_CR330) sound wisdom;
