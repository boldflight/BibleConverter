### The Reign of the Lord’s Anointed

  > who [†](#Pstext_EFN1) walks not in [†](#Pstext_EFN2) the counsel of the wicked,

> nor stands in [†](#Pstext_EFN3) the way of sinners,

  > nor [†](#Pstext_EFN4) sits in [†](#Pstext_EFN5) the seat of [†](#Pstext_EFN6) scoffers;

> **2** [✞] but his [†](#Pstext_EFN7) delight is in the law [*](#Ps_NC2) of the L**ORD**,

  > and on his [†](#Pstext_EFN8) law he meditates day and night.

> **3** [✞] He is like [†](#Pstext_EFN9) a tree

  > planted by [†](#Pstext_EFN10) streams of water

> that yields its fruit in its season,

  > and its [†](#Pstext_EFN11) leaf does not wither.

> [†](#Pstext_EFN12) In all that he does, he prospers.

> **4** [✞] The wicked are not so,

  > but are like [†](#Pstext_EFN13) chaff that the wind drives away.

> **5**  Therefore the wicked [†](#Pstext_EFN14) will not stand in the judgment,

  > nor sinners in [†](#Pstext_EFN15) the congregation of the righteous;

> **6** [✞] for the L**ORD** [†](#Pstext_EFN16) knows [†](#Pstext_EFN17) the way of the righteous,

  > but the way of the wicked will perish.

  > and the peoples plot in vain?

> **2** [✞] The kings of the earth set themselves,

  > and the rulers take counsel together,

  > against the L**ORD** and against his [†](#Pstext_EFN20) Anointed, saying,

> **3** [✞] “Let us [†](#Pstext_EFN21) burst their bonds apart

  > and cast away their cords from us.”

> **4** [✞] He who [†](#Pstext_EFN22) sits in the heavens [†](#Pstext_EFN23) laughs;

  > the Lord holds them in derision.

> **5**  Then he will speak to them in his [†](#Pstext_EFN24) wrath,

  > and terrify them in his fury, saying,

> **6** [✞] “As for me, I have [†](#Pstext_EFN25) set my King

  > on [†](#Pstext_EFN26) Zion, my [†](#Pstext_EFN27) holy hill.”

> **7** [✞] I will tell of the decree:

> The L**ORD** said to me, [†](#Pstext_EFN28) “You are my Son;

  > today I have begotten you.

> **8**  Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage,

  > and [†](#Pstext_EFN29) the ends of the earth your possession.

> **9**  You shall [†](#Pstext_EFN30) break [*](#Ps_NC4) them with [†](#Pstext_EFN31) a rod of iron

  > and dash them in pieces like [†](#Pstext_EFN32) a potter’s vessel.”

> **10** [✞] Now therefore, O kings, be wise;

  > be warned, O rulers of the earth.

> **11**  [†](#Pstext_EFN33) Serve the L**ORD** with [†](#Pstext_EFN34) fear,

  > and [†](#Pstext_EFN35) rejoice with [†](#Pstext_EFN34) trembling.

> **12** [✞] [†](#Pstext_EFN36) Kiss [†](#Pstext_EFN37) the Son,

  > lest he be angry, and you perish in the way,

  > for his [†](#Pstext_EFN38) wrath is quickly kindled.

> [†](#Pstext_EFN39) Blessed are all who take refuge in him.

> O L**ORD**, [†](#Pstext_EFN41) how many are my foes!

  > Many are [†](#Pstext_EFN42) rising against me;

> **2** [✞] many are saying of my soul,

  > [†](#Pstext_EFN43) “There is no salvation for him in God.” Selah [*](#Ps_NC5)

> **3** [✞] But you, O L**ORD**, are [†](#Pstext_EFN44) a shield [†](#Pstext_EFN45) about me,

  > my glory, and [†](#Pstext_EFN46) the lifter of my head.

> **4** [✞] I [†](#Pstext_EFN47) cried aloud to the L**ORD**,

  > and he [†](#Pstext_EFN48) answered me from his [†](#Pstext_EFN49) holy hill. Selah

> **5** [✞] I [†](#Pstext_EFN50) lay down and slept;

  > I woke again, for the L**ORD** sustained me.

> **6**  I [†](#Pstext_EFN51) will not be afraid of many thousands of people

  > who have [†](#Pstext_EFN52) set themselves against me all around.

> **7** [✞] [†](#Pstext_EFN53) Arise, O L**ORD**!

  > Save me, O my God!

> For you [†](#Pstext_EFN54) strike all my enemies on the cheek;

  > you [†](#Pstext_EFN55) break the teeth of the wicked.

> **8** [✞] [†](#Pstext_EFN56) Salvation belongs to the L**ORD**;

  > your blessing be on your people! Selah

> Answer me when I call, O God of my [†](#Pstext_EFN58) righteousness!

  > You have [†](#Pstext_EFN59) given me relief when I was in distress.

  > Be gracious to me and hear my prayer!

> **2** [✞] O men, [*](#Ps_NC6) how long shall my honor be turned into shame?

  > How long will you love vain words and seek after [†](#Pstext_EFN60) lies? Selah

> **3** [✞] But know that the L**ORD** has [†](#Pstext_EFN61) set apart [†](#Pstext_EFN62) the godly for himself;

  > the L**ORD** hears when I call to him.

> **4** [✞] [†](#Pstext_EFN63) Be angry, [*](#Ps_NC7) and do not sin;

  > [†](#Pstext_EFN64) ponder in your own hearts [†](#Pstext_EFN65) on your beds, and be silent. Selah

> **5** [✞] Offer [†](#Pstext_EFN66) right sacrifices,

  > and put your [†](#Pstext_EFN67) trust in the L**ORD**.

> **6** [✞] There are many who say, “Who will show us some good?

  > [†](#Pstext_EFN68) Lift up [†](#Pstext_EFN69) the light of your face upon us, O L**ORD**!”

> **7**  You have put [†](#Pstext_EFN70) more joy in my heart

  > than they have when their grain and wine abound.

> **8** [✞] In peace I will both [†](#Pstext_EFN71) lie down and sleep;

  > for you alone, O L**ORD**, make me [†](#Pstext_EFN72) dwell in safety.

> Give ear to my words, O L**ORD**;

  > consider my [†](#Pstext_EFN73) groaning.

> **2** [✞] Give attention to the sound of my cry,

  > my [†](#Pstext_EFN74) King and my God,

  > for [†](#Pstext_EFN75) to you do I pray.

> **3** [✞] O L**ORD**, in [†](#Pstext_EFN76) the morning you hear my voice;

  > in the morning I prepare a sacrifice for you [*](#Ps_NC8) and [†](#Pstext_EFN77) watch.

> **4** [✞] For you are not a God who delights in wickedness;

  > evil may not dwell with you.

> **5**  The [†](#Pstext_EFN78) boastful shall not [†](#Pstext_EFN79) stand before your eyes;

  > you [†](#Pstext_EFN80) hate all evildoers.

> **6**  You destroy those who speak [†](#Pstext_EFN81) lies;

  > the L**ORD** abhors [†](#Pstext_EFN82) the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.

> **7** [✞] But I, through the abundance of your steadfast love,

  > will enter your house.

> I will [†](#Pstext_EFN83) bow down [†](#Pstext_EFN84) toward your [†](#Pstext_EFN85) holy temple

  > in the fear of you.

> **8** [✞] [†](#Pstext_EFN86) Lead me, O L**ORD**, in your righteousness

  > because of my enemies;

  > [†](#Pstext_EFN87) make your way straight before me.

> **9** [✞] For there is no truth in their mouth;

  > their inmost self is [†](#Pstext_EFN88) destruction;

> [†](#Pstext_EFN89) their throat is [†](#Pstext_EFN90) an open grave;

  > they [†](#Pstext_EFN91) flatter with their tongue.

> **10** [✞] [†](#Pstext_EFN92) Make them bear their guilt, O God;

  > let them [†](#Pstext_EFN93) fall by their own counsels;

> because of the abundance of their transgressions cast them out,

  > for they have rebelled against you.

> **11** [✞] But let all who [†](#Pstext_EFN94) take refuge in you [†](#Pstext_EFN95) rejoice;

  > let them ever sing for joy,

> and spread your protection over them,

  > that those who love your name may [†](#Pstext_EFN96) exult in you.

> **12** [✞] For you [†](#Pstext_EFN97) bless the righteous, O L**ORD**;

  > you [†](#Pstext_EFN98) cover him with favor as with [†](#Pstext_EFN99) a shield.

> **1**  O L**ORD**, [†](#Pstext_EFN101) rebuke me not in your anger,

  > nor [†](#Pstext_EFN102) discipline me in your wrath.

> **2** [✞] Be gracious to me, O L**ORD**, for I am languishing;

  > [†](#Pstext_EFN103) heal me, O L**ORD**, [†](#Pstext_EFN104) for my bones are troubled.

> **3** [✞] My [†](#Pstext_EFN105) soul also is greatly troubled.

  > But you, O L**ORD**—[†](#Pstext_EFN106) how long?

> **4** [✞] Turn, O L**ORD**, deliver my life;

  > save me for the sake of your steadfast love.

> **5** [✞] For in [†](#Pstext_EFN107) death there is no remembrance of you;

  > in Sheol who will give you praise?

> **6**  I am [†](#Pstext_EFN108) weary with my [†](#Pstext_EFN109) moaning;

  > every night I flood my bed with tears;

  > I drench my couch with my weeping.

> **7**  My [†](#Pstext_EFN110) eye wastes away because of grief;

  > it grows weak because of all my foes.

> **8** [✞] [†](#Pstext_EFN111) Depart from me, all you [†](#Pstext_EFN112) workers of evil,

  > for the L**ORD** [†](#Pstext_EFN113) has heard the sound of my weeping.

> **9**  The L**ORD** has heard my [†](#Pstext_EFN114) plea;

  > the L**ORD** accepts my prayer.

> **10**  All my enemies shall be ashamed and greatly troubled;

  > they shall [†](#Pstext_EFN115) turn back and be put to shame in a moment.

> **1** [✞] O L**ORD** my God, in you do I [†](#Pstext_EFN117) take refuge;

  > [†](#Pstext_EFN118) save me from all my pursuers and deliver me,

> **2** [✞] lest like [†](#Pstext_EFN119) a lion they tear my soul apart,

  > rending it in pieces, with [†](#Pstext_EFN120) none to deliver.

> **3**  O L**ORD** my God, [†](#Pstext_EFN121) if I have done this,

  > if there is [†](#Pstext_EFN122) wrong in my hands,

> **4**  if I have repaid [†](#Pstext_EFN123) my friend [*](#Ps_NC11) with evil

  > or [†](#Pstext_EFN124) plundered my enemy without cause,

> **5** [✞] let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake it,

  > and let him [†](#Pstext_EFN125) trample my life to the ground

  > and lay my glory in the dust. Selah

> **6** [✞] [†](#Pstext_EFN126) Arise, O L**ORD**, in your anger;

  > [†](#Pstext_EFN127) lift yourself up against the fury of my enemies;

  > [†](#Pstext_EFN128) awake for me; you have appointed a judgment.

> **7**  Let the assembly of the peoples be gathered about you;

  > over it return on high.

> **8** [✞] The L**ORD** [†](#Pstext_EFN129) judges the peoples;

  > [†](#Pstext_EFN130) judge me, O L**ORD**, according to my righteousness

  > and according to the integrity that is in me.

> **9**  Oh, let the evil of the wicked come to an end,

  > and may you establish the righteous—

> you who [†](#Pstext_EFN131) test [†](#Pstext_EFN132) the minds and hearts, [*](#Ps_NC12)

  > O righteous God!

> **10** [✞] My shield is [†](#Pstext_EFN133) with God,

  > who saves [†](#Pstext_EFN134) the upright in heart.

> **11**  God is [†](#Pstext_EFN135) a righteous judge,

  > and a God who feels [†](#Pstext_EFN136) indignation every day.

> **12**  If a man [*](#Ps_NC13) does not repent, God [*](#Ps_NC14) will [†](#Pstext_EFN137) whet his sword;

  > he has [†](#Pstext_EFN138) bent and [†](#Pstext_EFN139) readied his bow;

> **13**  he has prepared for him his deadly weapons,

  > making his [†](#Pstext_EFN140) arrows [†](#Pstext_EFN141) fiery shafts.

> **14** [✞] Behold, the wicked man [†](#Pstext_EFN142) conceives evil

  > and is [†](#Pstext_EFN142) pregnant with mischief

  > and gives birth to lies.

> **15**  He makes [†](#Pstext_EFN143) a pit, digging it out,

  > and falls into the hole that he has made.

> **16**  His [†](#Pstext_EFN144) mischief returns upon his own head,

  > and on his own skull his violence descends.

> **17**  I will give to the L**ORD** the thanks due to his righteousness,

  > and I will [†](#Pstext_EFN145) sing praise to the name of the L**ORD**, the Most High.

> O L**ORD**, our Lord,

  > how majestic is your [†](#Pstext_EFN147) name in all the earth!

> You have set your [†](#Pstext_EFN148) glory above the heavens.

  > **2** [✞] [†](#Pstext_EFN149) Out of the mouth of babies and infants,

> you have established [†](#Pstext_EFN150) strength because of your foes,

  > to still [†](#Pstext_EFN151) the enemy and the avenger.

> **3** [✞] When I [†](#Pstext_EFN152) look at your heavens, the work of your [†](#Pstext_EFN153) fingers,

  > the moon and the stars, [†](#Pstext_EFN154) which you have set in place,

> **4** [✞] [†](#Pstext_EFN155) what is man that you are [†](#Pstext_EFN156) mindful of him,

  > and [†](#Pstext_EFN157) the son of man that you [†](#Pstext_EFN158) care for him?

> **5** [✞] Yet you have made him a little lower than [†](#Pstext_EFN159) the heavenly beings [*](#Ps_NC16)

  > and crowned him with [†](#Pstext_EFN160) glory and honor.

> **6** [✞] You have given him [†](#Pstext_EFN161) dominion over the works of your hands;

  > [†](#Pstext_EFN162) you have put all things under his feet,

> **7**  all sheep and oxen,

  > and also the beasts of the field,

> **8**  the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea,

  > whatever passes along the paths of the seas.

> **9** [✞] O L**ORD**, our Lord,

  > how majestic is your name in all the earth!

> I will give thanks to the L**ORD** with my whole heart;

  > I will recount all of your [†](#Pstext_EFN163) wonderful deeds.

> **2**  I will be glad and [†](#Pstext_EFN164) exult in you;

  > I will [†](#Pstext_EFN165) sing praise to your name, [†](#Pstext_EFN166) O Most High.

> **3** [✞] When my enemies turn back,

  > they stumble and perish before [*](#Ps_NC19) your presence.

> **4** [✞] For you have [†](#Pstext_EFN167) maintained my just cause;

  > you have [†](#Pstext_EFN168) sat on the throne, giving righteous judgment.

> **5** [✞] You have [†](#Pstext_EFN169) rebuked the nations; you have made the wicked perish;

  > you have [†](#Pstext_EFN170) blotted out their name forever and ever.

> **6**  The enemy came to an end in everlasting ruins;

  > their cities you rooted out;

  > the very memory of them has perished.

> **7** [✞] But the L**ORD** sits enthroned forever;

  > he has established his throne for justice,

> **8** [✞] and he [†](#Pstext_EFN171) judges the world with righteousness;

  > he [†](#Pstext_EFN172) judges the peoples with uprightness.

> **9**  The L**ORD** is [†](#Pstext_EFN173) a stronghold for [†](#Pstext_EFN174) the oppressed,

  > a stronghold in [†](#Pstext_EFN175) times of trouble.

> **10**  And those who [†](#Pstext_EFN176) know your name put their trust in you,

  > for you, O L**ORD**, have not forsaken those who seek you.

> **11** [✞] Sing praises to the L**ORD**, who [†](#Pstext_EFN177) sits enthroned in Zion!

  > Tell among the peoples his [†](#Pstext_EFN178) deeds!

> **12** [✞] For he who [†](#Pstext_EFN179) avenges blood is mindful of them;

  > he [†](#Pstext_EFN180) does not forget the cry of the afflicted.

> **13** [✞] [†](#Pstext_EFN181) Be gracious to me, O L**ORD**!

  > See my affliction from those who hate me,

  > O you who lift me up from [†](#Pstext_EFN182) the gates of death,

> **14** [✞] that I may recount all your praises,

  > that in the gates of [†](#Pstext_EFN183) the daughter of Zion

  > I may [†](#Pstext_EFN184) rejoice in your salvation.

> **15** [✞] The nations have sunk in [†](#Pstext_EFN185) the pit that they made;

  > in [†](#Pstext_EFN186) the net that they hid, their own foot has been caught.

> **16**  The L**ORD** has made himself [†](#Pstext_EFN187) known; he has executed judgment;

  > the wicked are snared in the work of their own hands. Higgaion. [*](#Ps_NC20) Selah

> **17** [✞] The wicked shall [†](#Pstext_EFN188) return to Sheol,

  > all the nations that [†](#Pstext_EFN189) forget God.

> **18** [✞] For the needy shall not always be forgotten,

  > and [†](#Pstext_EFN190) the hope of the poor shall not perish forever.

> **19** [✞] [†](#Pstext_EFN191) Arise, O L**ORD**! Let not [†](#Pstext_EFN192) man prevail;

  > let the nations be judged before you!

> **20**  Put them in fear, O L**ORD**!

  > Let the nations know that they are but [†](#Pstext_EFN193) men! Selah

  > Why [†](#Pstext_EFN195) do you hide yourself in [†](#Pstext_EFN196) times of trouble?

> **2**  In arrogance the wicked hotly pursue the poor;

  > let them [†](#Pstext_EFN197) be caught in the schemes that they have devised.

> **3** [✞] For the wicked [†](#Pstext_EFN198) boasts of the desires of his soul,

  > and the one greedy for gain [†](#Pstext_EFN199) curses [*](#Ps_NC21) and [†](#Pstext_EFN200) renounces the L**ORD**.

> **4**  In the pride of his face [*](#Ps_NC22) the wicked does not [†](#Pstext_EFN201) seek him; [*](#Ps_NC23)

  > all his thoughts are, [†](#Pstext_EFN202) “There is no God.”

> **5** [✞] His ways prosper at all times;

  > your judgments are on high, [†](#Pstext_EFN203) out of his sight;

  > as for all his foes, he [†](#Pstext_EFN204) puffs at them.

> **6** [✞] He [†](#Pstext_EFN205) says in his heart, “I shall not be moved;

  > throughout all generations I [†](#Pstext_EFN206) shall not meet adversity.”

> **7** [✞] [†](#Pstext_EFN207) His mouth is filled with cursing and [†](#Pstext_EFN208) deceit and [†](#Pstext_EFN209) oppression;

  > [†](#Pstext_EFN210) under his tongue are [†](#Pstext_EFN211) mischief and [†](#Pstext_EFN212) iniquity.

> **8** [✞] He sits in ambush in the villages;

  > in [†](#Pstext_EFN213) hiding places he murders the innocent.

> His eyes stealthily watch for the helpless;

  > **9** [✞] he lurks in ambush like [†](#Pstext_EFN214) a lion in his [†](#Pstext_EFN215) thicket;

> he [†](#Pstext_EFN216) lurks that he may seize the poor;

  > he seizes the poor when he draws him into his [†](#Pstext_EFN217) net.

> **10**  The helpless are crushed, sink down,

  > and fall by his might.

> **11**  He says in his heart, “God has forgotten,

  > he has [†](#Pstext_EFN218) hidden his face, he [†](#Pstext_EFN219) will never see it.”

> **12** [✞] [†](#Pstext_EFN220) Arise, O L**ORD**; O God, [†](#Pstext_EFN221) lift up your hand;

  > [†](#Pstext_EFN222) forget not the afflicted.

> **13**  Why does the wicked [†](#Pstext_EFN223) renounce God

  > and say in his heart, “You will not [†](#Pstext_EFN224) call to account”?

> **14** [✞] But you do see, for you [†](#Pstext_EFN225) note mischief and vexation,

  > that you may take it into your hands;

> to you the helpless [†](#Pstext_EFN226) commits himself;

  > you have been [†](#Pstext_EFN227) the helper of the fatherless.

> **15**  [†](#Pstext_EFN228) Break the arm of the wicked and evildoer;

  > [†](#Pstext_EFN229) call his wickedness to account till you find none.

> **16** [✞] [†](#Pstext_EFN230) The L**ORD** is king forever and ever;

  > the [†](#Pstext_EFN231) nations perish from his land.

> **17** [✞] O L**ORD**, you hear the desire of the afflicted;

  > you will [†](#Pstext_EFN232) strengthen their heart; you will incline your ear

> **18** [✞] to [†](#Pstext_EFN233) do justice to the fatherless and [†](#Pstext_EFN234) the oppressed,

  > so that [†](#Pstext_EFN235) man who is of the earth may strike terror no more.

> In the L**ORD** I take refuge;

> how can you say to my soul,

  > [†](#Pstext_EFN236) “Flee like a bird to your mountain,

> **2** [✞] for behold, the wicked [†](#Pstext_EFN237) bend the bow;

  > [†](#Pstext_EFN238) they have fitted their arrow to the string

  > to shoot in the dark at the upright in heart;

> **3** [✞] if [†](#Pstext_EFN239) the foundations are destroyed,

  > what can the righteous do?” [*](#Ps_NC24)

> **4** [✞] [†](#Pstext_EFN240) The L**ORD** is in his holy temple;

  > the L**ORD**’s [†](#Pstext_EFN241) throne is in heaven;

  > his eyes see, his eyelids [†](#Pstext_EFN242) test the children of man.

> **5**  The L**ORD** [†](#Pstext_EFN243) tests the righteous,

  > but [†](#Pstext_EFN244) his soul hates the wicked and the one who loves violence.

> **6** [✞] Let him rain coals on the wicked;

  > [†](#Pstext_EFN245) fire and sulfur and a scorching wind shall be [†](#Pstext_EFN246) the portion of their cup.

> **7** [✞] For the L**ORD** is righteous;

> he [†](#Pstext_EFN247) loves righteous deeds;

  > [†](#Pstext_EFN248) the upright shall behold his face.

> Save, O L**ORD**, for [†](#Pstext_EFN249) the godly one is gone;

  > for the faithful have vanished from among the children of man.

> **2** [✞] Everyone [†](#Pstext_EFN250) utters lies to his neighbor;

  > with [†](#Pstext_EFN251) flattering lips and [†](#Pstext_EFN252) a double heart they speak.

> **3** [✞] May the L**ORD** cut off all [†](#Pstext_EFN253) flattering lips,

  > the tongue that makes [†](#Pstext_EFN254) great boasts,

> **4** [✞] those who say, “With our tongue we will prevail,

> **5** [✞] “Because [†](#Pstext_EFN255) the poor are plundered, because the needy groan,

  > [†](#Pstext_EFN256) I will now arise,” says the L**ORD**;

  > “I will place him in the [†](#Pstext_EFN257) safety for which he longs.”

> **6** [✞] [†](#Pstext_EFN258) The words of the L**ORD** are pure words,

  > like silver refined in a furnace on the ground,

  > purified seven times.

> **7** [✞] You, O L**ORD**, will keep them;

  > you will guard us [*](#Ps_NC26) from this generation forever.

> **8** [✞] On every side the wicked prowl,

  > as vileness is exalted among the children of man.

> [†](#Pstext_EFN259) How long, O L**ORD**? Will you [†](#Pstext_EFN260) forget me forever?

  > How long will you [†](#Pstext_EFN261) hide your face from me?

> **2** [✞] How long must I take [†](#Pstext_EFN262) counsel in my soul

  > and have sorrow in my heart all the day?

> How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?

> **3** [✞] [†](#Pstext_EFN263) Consider and answer me, O L**ORD** my God;
