### Greeting

1 [✞] Paul, a servant [*](#Ti_NC1) of God and [†](#Titext_EFN1) an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the sake of the faith of God’s elect and [†](#Titext_EFN2) their knowledge of the truth, [†](#Titext_EFN3) which accords with godliness,

**2** [✞] [†](#Titext_EFN4) in hope of eternal life, which God, [†](#Titext_EFN5) who never lies, [†](#Titext_EFN6) promised [†](#Titext_EFN7) before the ages began [*](#Ti_NC2)

**3** [✞] and [†](#Titext_EFN8) at the proper time manifested in his word[*](#Ti_NC3) [†](#Titext_EFN9) through the preaching [†](#Titext_EFN10) with which I have been entrusted [†](#Titext_EFN11) by the command of God our Savior;

**4** [✞] To Titus, [†](#Titext_EFN12) my true child in [†](#Titext_EFN13) a common faith:[†](#Titext_EFN14) Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.

**5** [✞] [†](#Titext_EFN15) This is why I left you in Crete, so that you might put what remained into order, and [†](#Titext_EFN16) appoint elders in every town as I directed you—

**6** [✞] [†](#Titext_EFN17) if anyone is above reproach, the husband of one wife, [*](#Ti_NC4) and his children are believers [*](#Ti_NC5) and not open to the charge of [†](#Titext_EFN18) debauchery or insubordination.

**7** [✞] For an overseer, [*](#Ti_NC6) [†](#Titext_EFN19) as God’s steward, must be above reproach. He must not [†](#Titext_EFN20) be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent [†](#Titext_EFN21) or greedy for gain,

**8** [✞] but hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, [†](#Titext_EFN22) and disciplined.

**9** [✞] He must [†](#Titext_EFN23) hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in [†](#Titext_EFN24) sound [*](#Ti_NC7a) doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it.

**10** [✞] For there are many who are insubordinate, [†](#Titext_EFN25) empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of [†](#Titext_EFN26) the circumcision party. [*](#Ti_NC7)

**11** [✞] They must be silenced, since [†](#Titext_EFN27) they are upsetting whole families by teaching [†](#Titext_EFN28) for shameful gain what they ought not to teach.

**12** [✞] [†](#Titext_EFN29) One of the Cretans, [*](#Ti_NC8) a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.” [*](#Ti_NC9)

**13** [✞] This testimony is true. Therefore [†](#Titext_EFN30) rebuke them [†](#Titext_EFN31) sharply, that they [†](#Titext_EFN32) may be sound in the faith,

**14** [✞] [†](#Titext_EFN33) not devoting themselves to Jewish myths and [†](#Titext_EFN34) the commands of people [†](#Titext_EFN35) who turn away from the truth.

**15** [✞] [†](#Titext_EFN36) To the pure, all things are pure, but to the defiled and [†](#Titext_EFN37) unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both [†](#Titext_EFN38) their minds and their consciences are defiled.

**16** [✞] [†](#Titext_EFN39) They profess to know God, but they [†](#Titext_EFN40) deny him by their works. They are detestable, disobedient, [†](#Titext_EFN41) unfit for any good work.2 [✞] But as for you, teach what accords with [†](#Titext_EFN42) sound [*](#Ti_NC10) doctrine.

**2** [✞] Older men are to be sober-minded, dignified, self-controlled, [†](#Titext_EFN43) sound in faith, in love, and in steadfastness.

**3** [✞] [†](#Titext_EFN44) Older women likewise are to be reverent in behavior, [†](#Titext_EFN45) not slanderers [†](#Titext_EFN46) or slaves to much wine. They are to teach what is good,

**4** [✞] and so train the young women to love their husbands and children,

**5** [✞] to be self-controlled, [†](#Titext_EFN47) pure, [†](#Titext_EFN48) working at home, kind, and [†](#Titext_EFN49) submissive to their own husbands, [†](#Titext_EFN50) that the word of God may not be reviled.

**6**  Likewise, urge [†](#Titext_EFN51) the younger men to be self-controlled.

**7** [✞] Show yourself in all respects to be [†](#Titext_EFN52) a model of good works, and in your teaching [†](#Titext_EFN53) show integrity, [†](#Titext_EFN54) dignity,

**8**  and [†](#Titext_EFN55) sound speech that cannot be condemned, [†](#Titext_EFN56) so that an opponent may be put to shame, having nothing evil to say about us.

**9** [✞] [†](#Titext_EFN57) Bondservants [*](#Ti_NC11) are to be submissive to their own masters [†](#Titext_EFN58) in everything; they are to be well-pleasing, not argumentative,

**10** [✞] not pilfering, [†](#Titext_EFN59) but showing all good faith, [†](#Titext_EFN60) so that in everything they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior.

**11** [✞] For [†](#Titext_EFN61) the grace of God [†](#Titext_EFN62) has appeared, bringing salvation [†](#Titext_EFN63) for all people,

**12**  training us to renounce ungodliness and [†](#Titext_EFN64) worldly passions, and [†](#Titext_EFN65) to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in [†](#Titext_EFN66) the present age,

**13** [✞] [†](#Titext_EFN67) waiting for our blessed [†](#Titext_EFN68) hope, the [†](#Titext_EFN69) appearing of the glory of our great [†](#Titext_EFN70) God and Savior Jesus Christ,

**14** [✞] [†](#Titext_EFN71) who gave himself for us to [†](#Titext_EFN72) redeem us from all lawlessness and [†](#Titext_EFN73) to purify for himself [†](#Titext_EFN73) a people for his own possession who are [†](#Titext_EFN74) zealous for good works.

**15** [✞] Declare these things; exhort and [†](#Titext_EFN75) rebuke with all authority. [†](#Titext_EFN76) Let no one disregard you.3 [✞] Remind them [†](#Titext_EFN77) to be submissive to rulers and authorities, [†](#Titext_EFN78) to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,

**2**  [†](#Titext_EFN79) to speak evil of no one, [†](#Titext_EFN80) to avoid quarreling, to be gentle, and [†](#Titext_EFN81) to show perfect courtesy toward all people.

**3** [✞] For [†](#Titext_EFN82) we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, hated by others and hating one another.

**4** [✞] But when [†](#Titext_EFN83) the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared,

**5** [✞] he saved us, [†](#Titext_EFN84) not because of works done by us in righteousness, but [†](#Titext_EFN85) according to his own mercy, by [†](#Titext_EFN86) the washing of regeneration and [†](#Titext_EFN87) renewal of the Holy Spirit,

**6**  whom he [†](#Titext_EFN88) poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,

**7** [✞] so that [†](#Titext_EFN89) being justified by his grace we might become [†](#Titext_EFN90) heirs [†](#Titext_EFN91) according to the hope of eternal life.

**8** [✞] The saying is [†](#Titext_EFN92) trustworthy, and I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed in God may be careful [†](#Titext_EFN93) to devote themselves to good works. These things are excellent and profitable for people.

**9** [✞] But [†](#Titext_EFN94) avoid foolish [†](#Titext_EFN95) controversies, [†](#Titext_EFN96) genealogies, dissensions, and quarrels about the law, for [†](#Titext_EFN97) they are unprofitable and worthless.

**10** [✞] As for a person who stirs up division, [†](#Titext_EFN98) after warning him once and then twice, [†](#Titext_EFN99) have nothing more to do with him,

**11**  knowing that such a person is warped and sinful; he is self-condemned.

**12** [✞] When I send Artemas or [†](#Titext_EFN100) Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me [†](#Titext_EFN101) at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.

**13** [✞] Do your best to speed Zenas the lawyer and [†](#Titext_EFN102) Apollos on their way; see that they lack nothing.

**14** [✞] And let our people learn [†](#Titext_EFN103) to devote themselves to good works, so as to help cases of urgent need, and not [†](#Titext_EFN104) be unfruitful.

**15** [✞] All who are with me send greetings to you. Greet those who love us in the faith.[†](#Titext_EFN105) Grace be with you all.
