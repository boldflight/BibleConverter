### The Coming Judgment on Judah

1 [✞] The word of the L**ORD** that came to Zephaniah the son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah, [†](#Zeptext_EFN1) in the days of [†](#Zeptext_EFN2) Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.

> **2** [✞] [†](#Zeptext_EFN3) “I will utterly sweep away everything

  > from the face of the earth,” declares the L**ORD**.

> **3** [✞] “I will sweep away [†](#Zeptext_EFN4) man and beast;

  > I will sweep away the birds of the heavens

  > and [†](#Zeptext_EFN4) the fish of the sea,

> and [†](#Zeptext_EFN5) the rubble [*](#Zep_NC1) with the wicked.

  > I will [†](#Zeptext_EFN6) cut off mankind

  > from the face of the earth,” declares the L**ORD**.

> **4** [✞] “I will stretch out my hand against Judah

  > and against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem;

> [†](#Zeptext_EFN7) and I will cut off from this place the remnant of Baal

  > and the name of the idolatrous priests along with the priests,

> **5** [✞] [†](#Zeptext_EFN8) those who bow down on the roofs

  > to the host of the heavens,

> [†](#Zeptext_EFN9) those who bow down and swear to the L**ORD**

  > and yet swear by [†](#Zeptext_EFN10) Milcom,[*](#Zep_NC1a)

> **6** [✞] [†](#Zeptext_EFN11) those who have turned back from following the L**ORD**,

  > [†](#Zeptext_EFN12) who do not seek the L**ORD** or inquire of him.”

> **7** [✞] [†](#Zeptext_EFN13) Be silent before the Lord G**OD**!

  > For [†](#Zeptext_EFN14) the day of the L**ORD** is near;

> [†](#Zeptext_EFN15) the L**ORD** has prepared a sacrifice

  > and [†](#Zeptext_EFN16) consecrated his guests.

> **8** [✞] And on the day of the L**ORD**’s sacrifice—

> [†](#Zeptext_EFN17) “I will punish the officials and the king’s sons

  > and [†](#Zeptext_EFN18) all who array themselves in foreign attire.

> **9** [✞] On that day I will punish

  > everyone [†](#Zeptext_EFN19) who leaps over the threshold,

> and those who fill their master’s [*](#Zep_NC2) house

  > with violence and fraud.

> **10** [✞] “On that day,” declares the L**ORD**,

  > “a cry will be heard from [†](#Zeptext_EFN20) the Fish Gate,

> [†](#Zeptext_EFN21) a wail from [†](#Zeptext_EFN22) the Second Quarter,

  > a loud crash from the hills.

> **11** [✞] [†](#Zeptext_EFN23) Wail, O inhabitants of the Mortar!

  > For all the traders [*](#Zep_NC3) are no more;

  > all who weigh out silver are cut off.

> **12** [✞] At that time [†](#Zeptext_EFN24) I will search Jerusalem with lamps,

  > and I will punish the men

> [†](#Zeptext_EFN25) who are complacent, [*](#Zep_NC4)

  > [†](#Zeptext_EFN26) those who say in their hearts,

> ‘The L**ORD** will not do good,

  > nor will he do ill.’

> **13** [✞] Their goods shall be [†](#Zeptext_EFN27) plundered,

  > and their houses laid waste.

> [†](#Zeptext_EFN28) Though they build houses,

  > they shall not inhabit them;

> [†](#Zeptext_EFN29) though they plant vineyards,

  > they shall not drink wine from them.”

> **14** [✞] [†](#Zeptext_EFN30) The great day of the L**ORD** is near,

  > near and hastening fast;

> the sound of the day of the L**ORD** is bitter;

  > [†](#Zeptext_EFN31) the mighty man cries aloud there.

> **15** [✞] [†](#Zeptext_EFN32) A day of wrath is that day,

  > a day of distress and anguish,

> a day of [†](#Zeptext_EFN33) ruin and devastation,

  > [†](#Zeptext_EFN34) a day of darkness and gloom,

> [†](#Zeptext_EFN34) a day of clouds and thick darkness,

  > **16** [✞] [†](#Zeptext_EFN35) a day of trumpet blast and battle cry

> [†](#Zeptext_EFN36) against the fortified cities

  > and against the lofty battlements.

> **17** [✞] [†](#Zeptext_EFN37) I will bring distress on mankind,

  > so that they shall walk [†](#Zeptext_EFN38) like the blind,

  > because they have sinned against the L**ORD**;

> [†](#Zeptext_EFN39) their blood shall be poured out like dust,

  > and their flesh [†](#Zeptext_EFN40) like dung.

> **18** [✞] [†](#Zeptext_EFN41) Neither their silver nor their gold

  > shall be able to deliver them

  > on the day of the wrath of the L**ORD**.

> [†](#Zeptext_EFN42) In the fire of his jealousy,

  > [†](#Zeptext_EFN43) all the earth shall be consumed;

> [†](#Zeptext_EFN44) for a full and sudden end

  > he will make of all the inhabitants of the earth.

  > O [†](#Zeptext_EFN45) shameless nation,

> **2**  [†](#Zeptext_EFN46) before the decree takes effect [*](#Zep_NC5)

  > —before the day passes away [†](#Zeptext_EFN47) like chaff—

> [†](#Zeptext_EFN48) before there comes upon you

  > the burning anger of the L**ORD**,

> before there comes upon you

  > the day of the anger of the L**ORD**.

> **3** [✞] [†](#Zeptext_EFN49) Seek the L**ORD**, [†](#Zeptext_EFN50) all you humble of the land,

  > who do his just commands; [*](#Zep_NC6)

> [†](#Zeptext_EFN51) seek righteousness; seek humility;

  > [†](#Zeptext_EFN51) perhaps [†](#Zeptext_EFN52) you may be hidden

  > on the day of the anger of the L**ORD**.

> **4** [✞] [†](#Zeptext_EFN53) For Gaza shall be deserted,

  > and Ashkelon shall become a desolation;

> Ashdod’s people shall be driven out at noon,

  > and Ekron shall be uprooted.

> **5** [✞] Woe to [†](#Zeptext_EFN54) you inhabitants of the seacoast,

  > you nation of [†](#Zeptext_EFN55) the Cherethites!

> [†](#Zeptext_EFN56) The word of the L**ORD** is against you,

  > [†](#Zeptext_EFN57) O Canaan, land of the Philistines;

  > and I will destroy you [†](#Zeptext_EFN58) until no inhabitant is left.

> **6**  [†](#Zeptext_EFN59) And you, O seacoast, [†](#Zeptext_EFN60) shall be pastures,

  > with meadows [*](#Zep_NC7) for shepherds

  > and folds for flocks.

> **7** [✞] [†](#Zeptext_EFN61) The seacoast shall become the possession

  > of [†](#Zeptext_EFN62) the remnant of the house of Judah,

  > [†](#Zeptext_EFN63) on which they shall graze,

> and in the houses of Ashkelon

  > they shall lie down at evening.

> For the L**ORD** their God [†](#Zeptext_EFN64) will be mindful of them

  > and [†](#Zeptext_EFN65) restore their fortunes.

> **8** [✞] “I have heard [†](#Zeptext_EFN66) the taunts of Moab

  > and [†](#Zeptext_EFN67) the revilings of the Ammonites,

> how they have taunted my people

  > and made boasts [†](#Zeptext_EFN68) against their territory.

> **9** [✞] Therefore, [†](#Zeptext_EFN69) as I live,” declares the L**ORD** of hosts,

  > the God of Israel,

> “Moab shall become [†](#Zeptext_EFN70) like Sodom,

  > and the Ammonites [†](#Zeptext_EFN70) like Gomorrah,

> a land possessed by nettles and salt pits,

  > and a waste forever.

> The remnant of my people shall plunder them,

  > and the survivors of my nation shall possess them.”

> **10**  This shall be their lot in return [†](#Zeptext_EFN71) for their pride,

  > because they taunted and boasted

  > against the people of the L**ORD** of hosts.

> **11** [✞] The L**ORD** will be awesome against them;

  > [†](#Zeptext_EFN72) for he will famish all the gods of the earth,

> and [†](#Zeptext_EFN73) to him shall bow down,

  > each in its place,

  > all [†](#Zeptext_EFN74) the lands of the nations.

> **12** [✞] [†](#Zeptext_EFN75) You also, O Cushites,

  > shall be slain by my sword.

> **13** [✞] And he will stretch out his hand against the north

  > [†](#Zeptext_EFN76) and destroy Assyria,

> and he [†](#Zeptext_EFN77) will make Nineveh a desolation,

  > a dry waste like the desert.

> **14**  [†](#Zeptext_EFN78) Herds shall lie down in her midst,

  > all kinds of beasts; [*](#Zep_NC8)

> [†](#Zeptext_EFN79) even the owl and the hedgehog [*](#Zep_NC9)

  > shall lodge in her capitals;

> a voice shall hoot in the window;

  > devastation will be on the threshold;

  > for [†](#Zeptext_EFN80) her cedar work will be laid bare.

> **15** [✞] This is the exultant city

  > [†](#Zeptext_EFN81) that lived securely,

> that said in her heart,

  > “I am, and there is no one else.”

> What a desolation she has become,

  > [†](#Zeptext_EFN82) a lair for wild beasts!

> [†](#Zeptext_EFN83) Everyone who passes by her

  > hisses and [†](#Zeptext_EFN84) shakes his fist.

  > [†](#Zeptext_EFN85) the oppressing city!

> **2** [✞] She listens to no voice;

  > [†](#Zeptext_EFN86) she accepts no correction.

> [†](#Zeptext_EFN87) She does not trust in the L**ORD**;

  > she does not draw near to her God.

> **3** [✞] [†](#Zeptext_EFN88) Her officials within her

  > are roaring lions;

> her judges are [†](#Zeptext_EFN89) evening wolves

  > that leave nothing till the morning.

> **4** [✞] [†](#Zeptext_EFN90) Her prophets are fickle, treacherous men;

> [†](#Zeptext_EFN90) her priests [†](#Zeptext_EFN91) profane what is holy;

  > they do violence to the law.

> **5** [✞] The L**ORD** within her [†](#Zeptext_EFN92) is righteous;

  > he does no injustice;

> every morning he shows forth his justice;

  > each dawn he does not fail;

  > but [†](#Zeptext_EFN93) the unjust knows no shame.

> **6** [✞] [†](#Zeptext_EFN94) “I have cut off nations;

  > their battlements are in ruins;

> I have laid waste their streets

  > [†](#Zeptext_EFN95) so that no one walks in them;

> their cities have been made desolate,

  > without a man, without an inhabitant.

> **7** [✞] [†](#Zeptext_EFN96) I said, ‘Surely you will fear me;

  > [†](#Zeptext_EFN97) you will accept correction.

> Then your [*](#Zep_NC10) dwelling would not be cut off

  > according to all that I have appointed against you.’ [*](#Zep_NC11)

> But [†](#Zeptext_EFN98) all the more they were eager

  > to make all their deeds corrupt.

> **8** [✞] “Therefore [†](#Zeptext_EFN99) wait for me,” declares the L**ORD**,

  > “for the day when I rise up to seize the prey.

> For my decision is [†](#Zeptext_EFN100) to gather nations,

  > to assemble kingdoms,

> to pour out upon them my indignation,

  > all my burning anger;

> for in the fire of my jealousy

  > [†](#Zeptext_EFN101) all the earth shall be consumed.

> **9** [✞] “For at that time I will change the speech of the peoples

  > to [†](#Zeptext_EFN102) a pure speech,

> that all of them may call upon the name of the L**ORD**

  > and serve him with one accord.

> **10**  [†](#Zeptext_EFN103) From beyond the rivers [†](#Zeptext_EFN104) of Cush

  > my worshipers, the daughter of my dispersed ones,

  > shall bring my offering.

> **11** [✞] [†](#Zeptext_EFN105) “On that day [†](#Zeptext_EFN106) you shall not be put to shame

  > because of the deeds by which you have rebelled against me;

> for then [†](#Zeptext_EFN107) I will remove from your midst

  > your proudly exultant ones,

> and [†](#Zeptext_EFN108) you shall no longer be haughty

  > in my holy mountain.

> **12** [✞] But I will leave in your midst

  > a people [†](#Zeptext_EFN109) humble and lowly.

> [†](#Zeptext_EFN110) They shall seek refuge in the name of the L**ORD**,

  > **13** [✞] [†](#Zeptext_EFN111) those who are left in Israel;

> they [†](#Zeptext_EFN112) shall do no injustice

  > and speak no lies,

> [†](#Zeptext_EFN113) nor shall there be found in their mouth

  > a deceitful tongue.

> [†](#Zeptext_EFN114) For they shall graze and lie down,

  > and none shall make them afraid.”

> **14** [✞] [†](#Zeptext_EFN115) Sing aloud, O daughter of Zion;

  > shout, O Israel!

> Rejoice and exult with all your heart,

  > O daughter of Jerusalem!

> **15** [✞] The L**ORD** has taken away the judgments against you;

  > he has cleared away your enemies.

> [†](#Zeptext_EFN116) The King of Israel, [†](#Zeptext_EFN117) the L**ORD**, is in your midst;

  > you shall never again fear evil.

> **16**  [†](#Zeptext_EFN118) On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem:

> “Fear not, O Zion;

  > [†](#Zeptext_EFN119) let not your hands grow weak.

> **17** [✞] [†](#Zeptext_EFN120) The L**ORD** your God is in your midst,

  > [†](#Zeptext_EFN121) a mighty one who will save;

> [†](#Zeptext_EFN122) he will rejoice over you with gladness;

  > he will quiet you by his love;

> he will exult over you with loud singing.

> **18** [✞] I will gather those of you who mourn [†](#Zeptext_EFN123) for the festival,

  > so that you will no longer suffer reproach. [*](#Zep_NC12)

> **19** [✞] Behold, at that time [†](#Zeptext_EFN124) I will deal

  > with all your oppressors.

> And [†](#Zeptext_EFN125) I will save the lame

  > and gather the outcast,

> and I will change [†](#Zeptext_EFN126) their shame into [†](#Zeptext_EFN127) praise

  > and renown in all the earth.

> **20**  [†](#Zeptext_EFN128) At that time I will bring you in,

  > at the time when I gather you together;

> for I will make you renowned and praised

  > among all the peoples of the earth,

> [†](#Zeptext_EFN129) when I restore your fortunes

  > before your eyes,” says the L**ORD**.
